# Observation bound extents

Where each declared **observation bound** stops the measure — not how far a scan walks (that is
`ScanDepth`, an adopter's knob), but where this family's own reaction deliberately stops.

**56 of 105 declared bounds are declared false negatives** — the reaction fires less than the truth, which is the one direction this family treats as a defect. That figure leads this document because a number in a footnote is not read, and each such bound names who must act:

Generated from each dimension's `observation_bounds()` by `crates/kanhe/tests/observation_bound_model.rs`. **Do not edit by hand** — regenerate with

**What this document does not claim.** The classification is *authored*: the type refuses a contradiction and derives what each bound's defence must demonstrate, but nothing verifies that a bound recorded as over-reacting really over-reacts rather than under-reacting. This capability declares further limits as bounds of its own — among them, an answer that depends on which corpus entry point observed it has no extent of its own and is recorded as under-reacting with the entry point as its owner, and a bound both out of reach and granularity-limited cannot be expressed at all. The sections below list every one of them; this paragraph deliberately does not, because a list typed here is a literal in a template and the freshness check compares that text with itself. This disclosure is authored rather than derived from the specification and held both ways; the backlog carries that.

**refuses to judge** and *out of reach* are kept distinct deliberately. The misclassification this model exists to prevent was exactly a confusion between them — a prediction of a silent false negative where the real behaviour was a fail-loud refusal — and a direction that cannot be named cannot be predicted with.

## as intended, granularity bounded (5)

### `observation-bound-model/an-answer-that-depends-on-the-corpus-entry-point-has-no-extent-of-its-own-a-stated-bound`

> a bound whose outcome differs by which corpus entry point observed it

- **because**: it is recorded as an under-reaction owned by the entry point rather than carrying a value of its own, so it shares that value with bounds whose answer does not depend on an entry point; one live instance does not earn a value every other member has several of
- **its defence must show**: collapses granularity
- **pinned by**: `an_entry_dependent_bound_is_declared_as_under_reacting`

### `runtime-origin-assertion/an-absolute-path-literal-s-target-outside-the-anchor-keeps-its-absolute-label-a-stated-bound`

> a module reached only through an absolute `#[path = "/…"]` outside the scanning anchor

- **because**: the literal has no textual relationship to the anchor, so the site is named with the raw absolute path — the violation is still emitted
- **its defence must show**: collapses granularity
- **pinned by**: `an_absolute_path_literal_outside_the_anchor_keeps_the_path_the_literal_wrote`

### `runtime-origin-assertion/identical-expression-repeated-in-the-same-function-collapses-to-one-finding-a-stated-bound`

> `assert_boundary!(SEAM, obj)` written twice verbatim in one function

- **because**: no further source content distinguishes the two occurrences, so they share one finding — the site still reacts
- **its defence must show**: collapses granularity
- **pinned by**: `identical_expression_repeated_in_the_same_function_collapses_to_one_violation`

### `semantic-dyn-trait-boundary/a-public-item-naming-such-an-alias-is-not-expanded-a-stated-bound`

> a public item whose signature names a public alias that itself holds a `dyn`

- **because**: the `dyn` is already caught at the alias declaration, so naming it again through the item would be a second finding for one shape
- **its defence must show**: collapses granularity
- **pinned by**: `a_private_alias_hiding_a_dyn_is_a_stated_bound`

### `semantic-dyn-trait-boundary/an-unrenderable-sub-node-is-a-stated-bound`

> two trait objects differing only inside a sub-node that cannot be rendered

- **because**: a complex const-generic expression, a same-named macro, a `verbatim` type or a lifetime cannot be rendered stably, so the two share one subject and key — each still reacts on first occurrence, and only baseline-dedup granularity is bounded
- **its defence must show**: collapses granularity
- **pinned by**: `an_unrenderable_sub_node_is_a_stated_rendering_bound`

## declines to refuse (1)

### `semantic-trait-impl-locality/a-cfg-gated-module-with-an-absent-file-is-skipped-not-a-scan-error-a-stated-bound`

> a cfg-gated module declaration whose source file is absent from the checkout

- **because**: the whole-crate walk skips the module rather than failing the gate with a scan error, because an absent cfg-gated file is an ordinary checkout state and refusing to judge on it would make the gate unusable
- **its defence must show**: does not refuse
- **pinned by**: `hunyi::a_cfg_gated_module_with_no_file_is_skipped_not_errored`

## not a violation (3)

### `semantic-async-exposure-boundary/a-body-nested-module-is-a-stated-bound`

> `pub async fn` inside a `mod` declared in a function body

- **because**: a `mod` inside a fn body is not public API — it is unreachable as `crate::…`, so there is nothing exposed to react to
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `async_subtree_does_not_observe_a_body_nested_module`

### `semantic-reexport-exposure/an-underscore-rename-is-a-documented-bound`

> `pub use crate::infra::DbPool as _;` under a boundary forbidding that module

- **because**: `as _` binds no nameable path a consumer can reach, so nothing is exposed
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `restricted_and_private_and_underscore_reexports_do_not_react`

### `semantic-signature-coupling/a-plain-item-nested-the-same-way-stays-a-stated-bound`

> a plain item nested inside a body, where an `impl` in the same position is recovered

- **because**: a plain item there is genuinely scoped to that body and unreachable as `crate::…`, exactly like the body-nested-module bound
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_plain_fn_directly_in_a_const_body_stays_a_stated_bound`

## out of reach (25)

### `external-crate-confinement/a-confined-crate-use-inside-a-string-or-macro-body-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> a confined-crate `use` written inside a string literal or a macro body

- **because**: comments, string literals and macro bodies are stripped before scanning
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `confine_ignores_a_use_inside_a_string_literal`

### `inline-symbol-path-confinement/a-receiver-method-read-is-a-documented-bound`

> a read reached through a method call on a receiver

- **because**: no type inference is performed on the receiver, so the confined path is never resolved from the call site
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `inline_receiver_method_read_is_a_bound`

### `inline-symbol-path-confinement/an-external-crate-re-export-is-a-documented-bound`

> a confined path reached through an external crate's own re-export

- **because**: foreign ASTs are not scanned, so a re-export chain leaving this workspace is never followed
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `inline_foreign_reexport_of_the_confined_path_is_a_bound`

### `observation-bound-model/a-bound-both-out-of-reach-and-granularity-limited-cannot-be-expressed-a-stated-bound`

> a bound both invisible to the observation source and limited in the granularity of the fact it would have produced

- **because**: granularity is carried only by the as-intended extent, so the pair has no representation at all; no declared bound exhibits it, and offering granularity on every extent would invite a combination nothing shows while weakening the nesting that makes a contradiction unwritable
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `granularity_is_carried_only_by_the_as_intended_extent`

### `observation-bound-model/whether-a-declaration-s-stated-cause-is-the-real-cause-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> a declaration whose rationale names a cause that is not why the reaction stops

- **because**: the extent is typed and checkable while the rationale is prose the model never reads; requiring the two to agree would trade a fact for a heuristic
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_rationale_that_contradicts_its_extent_is_a_stated_bound`

### `observer-protocol/a-trait-object-on-a-wrapped-signature-s-continuation-line-is-not-seen-a-stated-bound`

> a public signature spanning several lines that names a trait object on a line not beginning with `pub `

- **because**: the reaction reads this crate lexically, one line at a time, because 渾儀 governs no module of it and the `dyn`-trait DSL offers only forbid-all and forbid-named-operands, so a declared exposure would be a name with no reaction
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_trait_object_on_a_continuation_line_is_not_recognized`

### `observer-protocol/whether-an-observer-s-declared-bounds-are-complete-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> an observer that declares some of its limits and omits others

- **because**: the trait compels a declaration and never a complete one; no reaction can enumerate the limits of a reaction it did not write, so an omission is invisible
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `an_observer_may_under_declare_its_bounds`

### `projection-register/whether-a-stated-regeneration-command-regenerates-its-document-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> a generated document whose header names a command that no longer regenerates it

- **because**: the header is read and never evaluated; running the command would mean re-entering the `cargo test` harness already running, or — for the shell mechanism — writing the projection into the tree the check is judging, which every gate in this family is forbidden from doing
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_regeneration_command_is_registered_and_never_run`

### `repository-checks/a-check-that-should-distinguish-a-region-and-does-not-a-stated-bound`

> a check judging a property over executed text on unclassified text — no region decision written, or one a neighbouring scan of the same file contradicts

- **because**: an absence is not a shape and nothing can scan for a filter never written, while a disagreement between two scans is visible only to something that can already recognize a region decision — the reaction measured against this repository and rejected for refusing more legitimate sites than defects
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *a check that never wrote a region decision is invisible*

### `repository-checks/a-hook-is-proposed-for-this-rule-a-stated-bound`

> a squash merge made anywhere but through the sanctioned wrapper

- **because**: a squash merge runs on GitHub's servers, so no local commit exists and no hook runs, and both values of the repository's squash-title setting append the serial; the check guards the sanctioned path to a merge, and a browser reaches no wrapper
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_merge_made_outside_the_wrapper_is_not_observed`

### `runtime-origin-assertion/source-outside-a-member-s-library-or-binary-target-subtree-is-out-of-scope-a-stated-bound`

> a probe or seam mention in `tests/`, `examples/`, or `build.rs`

- **because**: the audit's corpus is the member's library and binary targets, so it never reads those files at all
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `source_outside_lib_or_bin_target_subtree_is_out_of_scope_corpus_bound`

### `semantic-dyn-trait-boundary/a-macro-generated-dyn-is-a-documented-bound`

> a `dyn` appearing only in a macro's expansion, with no `dyn` token at the call site

- **because**: macros are not expanded — the universal 渾儀 macro-expansion bound — so the token never enters the observed AST
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_macro_generated_dyn_is_a_documented_coverage_bound`

### `semantic-dyn-trait-boundary/a-private-alias-hiding-a-dyn-in-a-public-position-is-a-stated-bound`

> a non-public `type` alias holding a `dyn`, named by a public signature

- **because**: the resolver does not expand `type` aliases, so the `dyn` is never seen from the public position that exposes it
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_private_alias_hiding_a_dyn_is_a_stated_bound`

### `semantic-dyn-trait-operand-boundary/a-genuinely-unresolvable-bare-principal-is-a-documented-bound`

> `dyn Frobnicate` where the bare principal has no `use`, no dependency, and no local declaration

- **because**: the oracle does not over-reach a single bare segment, so a prelude or glob-imported trait resolves to nothing rather than to a guess
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `dyn_operand_genuinely_unresolvable_bare_principal_is_a_bound`

### `semantic-forbidden-marker/an-unresolvable-hand-impl-self-type-is-a-documented-bound`

> a hand-written impl whose self-type arrives through a glob import

- **because**: a glob's leaves are not enumerable, so the self-type cannot be resolved to its definition — the co-located, `use`-imported, re-export-spelled and alias cases do resolve and react
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `an_unresolvable_glob_self_type_is_a_documented_bound`

### `semantic-impl-trait-operand-boundary/a-genuinely-unresolvable-bare-principal-is-a-documented-bound`

> `impl Frobnicate` where the bare principal has no `use`, no dependency, and no local declaration

- **because**: the same resolver limit as the `dyn` operand dimension — a single bare segment is not over-reached
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `impl_trait_operand_genuinely_unresolvable_bare_principal_is_a_bound`

### `semantic-reexport-exposure/a-non-forbidden-root-external-glob-is-a-documented-bound`

> `pub use worklane_core::spi::*;` under a boundary forbidding a different module of that crate

- **because**: an external glob's individual leaves are not enumerable, so none is observed
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `extern_glob_nonforbidden_root_is_a_stated_bound`

### `semantic-reexport-exposure/a-re-export-renamed-through-a-foreign-module-is-a-documented-bound`

> a re-export of a foreign prelude path that itself re-exports a forbidden module's type

- **because**: the foreign chain is not parsed, so only the written path is matched — the reaction never claims to have followed it
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `foreign_prelude_rename_is_a_stated_bound`

### `semantic-reexport-exposure/a-sibling-root-glob-is-a-documented-bound`

> `pub use crate::elsewhere::*;` where that module transitively re-exports a forbidden type

- **because**: the glob's leaves are not enumerable here, so the transitively re-exported leaf is never seen
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `sibling_root_glob_does_not_react`

### `semantic-reexport-exposure/an-ancestor-root-glob-spanning-a-deeper-forbidden-prefix-is-a-documented-bound`

> `pub use crate::infra::*;` where the forbidden prefix is deeper than the glob root

- **because**: whether the glob root publicly re-exports the deeper forbidden subtree cannot be enumerated — the sharper sub-case of the sibling glob, declared separately rather than lumped with it
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `ancestor_root_glob_over_a_deeper_forbidden_prefix_does_not_react`

### `semantic-signature-coupling/a-macro-under-another-name-is-not-treated-as-transparent-a-stated-bound`

> an arbitrary macro invocation whose body holds item-shaped content

- **because**: the invocation is not transparent and its body is not read — extracting from it would read an `impl` body's braces as an arm and report an item the macro may never emit
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `an_arbitrary_macro_body_is_not_read_as_transparent_arms`

### `semantic-trait-impl-exposure/a-glob-imported-type-in-an-impl-position-is-a-documented-bound`

> an impl position naming a type that arrives through a glob import

- **because**: a glob's leaves are not enumerable, so the type in that position resolves to nothing
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_glob_imported_type_in_an_impl_position_is_a_documented_coverage_bound`

### `semantic-trait-impl-locality/a-macro-generated-impl-is-a-documented-bound`

> an `impl` appearing only in a macro's expansion

- **because**: macros are not expanded, so the impl never enters the observed AST
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `a_macro_generated_impl_is_a_documented_bound`

### `semantic-unsafe-confinement/macro-generated-unsafe-is-a-documented-bound`

> an `unsafe` block or item appearing only in a macro's expansion

- **because**: macros are not expanded, so the `unsafe` token never enters the observed AST
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **pinned by**: `unsafe_in_a_macro_body_is_a_stated_bound`

### `semantic-visibility-boundary/a-macro-generated-item-is-a-documented-bound`

> a `pub` item appearing only in a macro's expansion

## over-reacts (14)

### `crate-dependency-boundary/an-optional-dependency-edge-is-observed-as-a-declared-one-a-stated-bound`

> a dependency edge declared `optional = true`, reachable only when a feature enables it

- **because**: the rules read the declared dependency set, and cargo reports an optional edge in it like any other, so an edge confined to a non-default feature is governed as though it were unconditional — no rule can express *only when that feature is on*
- **its defence must show**: reacts on a harmless shape
- **pinned by**: `an_optional_dependency_edge_is_observed_as_a_declared_one`

### `crate-source-boundary/a-git-plus-version-dependency-is-flagged-though-it-would-publish-a-stated-bound`

> a dependency declaring both `git` and `version` under a registry-only allowlist

- **because**: the rule governs the declared source kind, not publish-eligibility, so a dependency that would `cargo publish` successfully is still classified `Git`
- **its defence must show**: reacts on a harmless shape
- **pinned by**: `source_rule_flags_every_git_source_outside_a_registry_or_path_allowlist`

### `external-crate-confinement/cfg-gated-code-is-observed-as-written-a-stated-bound`

> a confined-crate import under a `#[cfg(...)]` the build would not enable

- **because**: the predicate is never evaluated, so a dead arm is observed as live — cfg-blindness inherited from the module scanner, which reacts wider than the build
- **its defence must show**: reacts on a harmless shape
- **pinned by**: `confine_external_crate_is_cfg_blind_to_unenabled_cfg_arms`

### `reference-integrity/a-code-span-shaped-like-an-object-is-refused-though-it-names-none-a-stated-bound`

> a code span in live prose carrying 4 to 40 lowercase hex characters with both a letter and a digit, which names something other than a commit

- **because**: the reader decides by shape and nothing in the tree distinguishes a value with that shape from a citation without resolving it against an object database. Resolving is declined because the verdict would then depend on the object store rather than on the tracked text: the job running this reader checks out full history, but jobs checking out at the default depth would answer clean over every citation, so the reader would report clean for a reason unrelated to the content. The ground first written here — that CI checks out one commit — was false, and is corrected rather than restated. Measured over the live corpus: no span of this shape names anything but a commit, so the over-reaction is unrealised rather than tolerated
- **its defence must show**: reacts on a harmless shape
- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *a code span shaped like an object that names none*

### `release-coherence/a-basename-an-entry-writes-for-another-reason-a-stated-bound`

> an adopter-facing entry naming something of its own — a basename, or the directory itself — that the judged repository also tracks under `scripts/`

- **because**: a word is matched against basenames as well as paths, because the document cites both forms; narrowing it to full paths would lose every bare citation, and deciding which of two files a bare name means is a judgement about the sentence rather than about the reference
- **its defence must show**: reacts on a harmless shape
- **pinned by**: `a_colliding_basename_is_a_stated_bound`

### `release-coherence/a-case-alias-of-a-member-directory-a-stated-bound`

> a catalog path differing from the member's directory only in case, on a case-insensitive filesystem

- **because**: the comparison is component-wise and case-sensitive on every host, so it answers the same everywhere and is right only where the filesystem is. Closing it means asking the filesystem, since case folding is the volume's rule rather than the string's — and a release gate whose verdict over one tree differs by the machine it runs on is worse than a refusal an author can read and argue with. This reader is also handed no repository to ask.

> a release section that discusses the breaking marker without marking anything

- **because**: the classifier reads the marker's presence rather than its position, so a section describing the marking rule is required to carry a migration it does not owe. The reach is kept deliberately: a positional matcher would stop observing a real break whose marker sits anywhere but an entry's first token, buying a false negative in the floor to remove a refusal an author can argue with

> a `--jobs` value cargo documents as a negative job count, refused by the wrapper's shape rule

- **because**: the shape rule asks one question of every value-taking arm, and a leading digit means a job count for one arm and nothing for `--package` or `--registry`. Admitting it means asking the shape question differently per arm, which is the arrangement one check exists to replace. The caller passes the count instead

> a worktree holding a path that is a legal filename and not UTF-8, which `ls-files -z --others` and `status -z` both answer as its own bytes

- **because**: a verdict is not owed on an input this reader cannot represent, and the alternative is worse than a refusal: collapsing the undecodable bytes to U+FFFD would make every comparison downstream against a name the repository does not hold, which is the property `xingbiao::path_identity` exists to keep. So the worktree read stops and the cleanliness judgement is never reached -- neither `clean` nor `dirty` for that tree.

- **because**: `demonstrates()` names the direction a defence must show and reaches the projection label and the contradiction classification, while no reader compares that prediction with what the cited test asserts. Deciding what a test demonstrates from its source is a judgement over code of the kind measured and rejected over prose, and unlike a citation that never runs or never bites there is no reaction here whose gap a fixture could exhibit

- **because**: the split is by what a check judges, and two mechanical rules were each measured unreliable: a text scan reads a comment naming a governance document as governance while a check scanning every tracked file names nothing, and the workspace marker means both `this needs the repository as its subject` and `this needs a fixture`.

- **because**: no reader of text can tell a name that should resolve from one that should not: such tokens routinely match no declaration in the tree, and the most frequent of those are Rust keywords, attribute names and std method names. Separating them needs type information about a receiver, which `inline-symbol-path-confinement` already declares unobserved

- **because**: requiring both a letter and a digit is what keeps the reader off two shapes this tree actually holds -- a long run of digits written as a figure, and an English word spelled from the hex alphabet -- and the price is the abbreviations that carry only one kind of character. Over uniformly random seven-character abbreviations that is 3.8%. The direction is deliberate, and its reason is not the one first written here: the Core Contract names a **silent** false negative as the one forbidden bug, so a miss is not the cheaper direction by default. What makes this one admissible is that it is not silent -- it is this declaration, with an owner and a tracker -- and the alternative is refusing prose that cites nothing, which no declaration would cover

- **because**: that phrase alone is the group a reader over text cannot separate: it is as often duration -- `admitted it for a window`, narrating how long something lasted -- as it is a pointer at a moving window, and telling the two apart is a judgement about the sentence, which is the prose instrument `AGENTS.md` records as designed, measured three times and rejected. It is the ground on which `the same window` is absent from the declared phrases entirely. This bound covered every declared phrase here until three of the groups a widened sweep reports were separated by SHAPE rather than by meaning -- a record carrier by path and by dated section, a marked quotation in backticks or single emphasis, and a generated projection's copy of either, which is a marked quotation by the same test. How many fall in each group is not written here: this reason is itself in the corpus it describes, and its projection moves the figure again

The leak is real and stays: an adopter reading `[0.4.0]` meets nine entries naming files they can never run, and closing it needs a form of repair that adds to the record instead of editing it

- **because**: directories are derived slash-terminated, and stripping that slash leaves a word indistinguishable from ordinary prose — `scripts` is an English plural this document already uses as one.

- **because**: the corpus is tracked Markdown, and widening it was measured rather than reasoned about: this repository's Rust sources carry census phrases as fixture input, where the figures are a parser's expected output and deliberately arbitrary, so admitting them would report a test asserting its own parser as a drifted document.

- **because**: the register's reader used to be text over Rust and not exhaustive over the language, where a byte char literal, a raw string, or a two-line closure parameter list could desynchronise a character scan entirely -- invisible to both of its readings at once, the unsafe direction this bound named. Reading this repository's own Rust with a real parser instead of scanning it closed that floor; what remains is not lexical. Whether a bare reference names the constructor taken by value or a local sharing its spelling is not written down anywhere a parse tree carries, and answering it needs name resolution, which a reader of syntax alone does not have

- **because**: the reader decides by what a stage's flags ask for -- `head`, or a `grep` whose flag cluster carries `q` or `m` -- rather than by literal spellings, which is why `grep -Eq` is caught where three prefix names missed it. Naming programs is still the instrument: the set that exits early is not closed, and the question behind it -- does this stage read its input to EOF -- is not one a reader over shell text can answer

The figures this repository writes in words are the small ones, and a set large enough to need three-digit words is one whose prose writes digits — so extending it upward buys nothing measurable, while a word reader that silently stops matching reads as covered

- **because**: a literal is one token, so what it carries is that token's text and not a call. Reading lines, this split in two: an ordinary literal escaped its quotes and dropped out on its own, while a RAW string carried the spelling verbatim and was reported -- an over-report that reading tokens closed rather than declared. One stop remains, in both forms. No mutation record isolates it: a literal's contents are not a token stream, so reaching into them is a different reader rather than a perturbation of this one

- **because**: a rename is decidable inside one file, where `use std::process::Command as Cmd` is written down, and this reader binds those. What a name means when it is bound somewhere else is not written down anywhere a parse tree carries, and answering it needs name resolution -- the same floor `a-construction-shape-the-register-s-reader-does-not-model-a-stated-bound` already names for this repository's other reader of its own Rust, reached here by the same road.

Measured across the tracked Rust: two sites take a program as a value, and one of them IS the builder every other read is routed through while the other names an `ssh-keygen` signature verifier.

- **because**: comments are what a lexer discards, and this reader asks one -- so the stop is what a token stream IS rather than an arm this check chose, which also closes the block-comment form a line-opening test could not see. What it costs is that a construction commented out rather than deleted is unread, and `unreachable_branch` is where commented-out code is the subject.

### `repository-checks/a-marker-is-reached-through-some-other-primitive-a-stated-bound`

> a sequence of backtick-delimited names paired by hand through `split_once`, `strip_prefix`, `strip_suffix` or `trim_matches`

- **because**: the reaction names the primitives whose shape settles the question: `split` and `find`, which are the two shapes `reading`'s own doc records replacing, and a marker count taken modulo two, which is a pairing whatever produced the count. These four remain because each is in live use for reading a SINGLE delimited value, where they are correct, so refusing them by name would refuse the honest use -- and what tells a pairing from a single read is the expression's shape rather than the primitive's name. Where the expression does settle it, the reaction takes it: that is the ground on which the parity of a `matches` count is refused rather than declared here

### `repository-checks/a-paragraph-repeated-in-prose-is-not-read-a-stated-bound`

> a paragraph repeated in a tracked file that is not Rust, including this repository's governance prose

- **because**: the corpus is Rust comments, where an identical adjacent pair has one cause. Markdown repeats identical adjacent lines for its own reasons -- a table's rule row, two list items that read the same -- so the same rule there reports text its author wrote. The prose corpora carry the weight this check exists to protect, so the stop is the one worth revisiting first if a shape with no false positive is found for them

### `repository-checks/a-paragraph-repeated-out-of-line-is-not-read-a-stated-bound`

> a comment paragraph repeated somewhere other than immediately after itself -- twenty lines down, in another function, or in another file

- **because**: adjacency is what a paste leaves behind, and it is also what can be judged without deciding whether a repetition is deliberate. Two paragraphs that read the same in different places are as often two sites documented alike as one pasted twice, and this repository keeps both -- so widening past adjacency would buy the rarer defect with a report the author has to argue with, which is the authoring tax `PROJECT.md` refuses

### `repository-checks/a-refusal-constructed-outside-the-register-s-corpus-is-not-triaged-a-stated-bound`

> a refusal constructed by a gate implemented under `crates/kanhe/tests`, beside the directions over it

- **because**: the register reads `crates/kanhe/src`, where a construction is held by a named direction or declared unheld. A gate whose judgement and directions share a file has no answer to *which direction observes this branch*, because every direction in the file can see it -- so triaging it means first deciding where such gates belong, which is a question about their location rather than about this register
- **its defence must show**: does not react
- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *a gate that is its own test is outside the refusal register*

### `repository-checks/a-tool-configuration-set-in-the-environment-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> a value a sanctioned wrapper refuses as an argument, exported into its environment instead

- **because**: the allowlist classifies ARGUMENTS, and cargo takes the same configuration from the environment -- measured on cargo 1.96.0, `--target not-a-real-triple` and `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=not-a-real-triple` produce the identical rustc-probe failure. Closing it is ordinary work here rather than another layer's, since the wrapper could scrub the environment before invoking cargo; it needs an allowlist over the environment, and legitimate setups export CARGO_HOME and CARGO_TARGET_DIR, so which set to admit is a decision this bound records instead of guessing

### `repository-checks/a-whitespace-preceded-shell-marker-inside-quotes-is-cut-a-stated-bound`

> a shell comment marker preceded by whitespace inside a quoted string, where bash keeps it as string content and the token-start rule cuts it

- **because**: executed text is deleted, so a property about it is judged over less than the line carries — the direction the Core Contract forbids, and one a sentence in the classifier recorded as reaching the Rust region alone while both run the same rule

### `repository-checks/an-input-edited-inside-its-own-post-gate-re-read-a-stated-bound`

> a pull request title, base branch or head branch changing between the wrapper's post-gate re-read of it and `gh pr merge`

- **because**: the wrapper pins what the merge RECORDS by construction -- the body travels as the value the gate judged, and the commit set is pinned through `--match-head-commit`, which the server decides atomically. What the merge is JUDGED AGAINST has to be re-read instead, and `gh` offers no equivalent precondition for the title, the base or the head branch's name, so a re-read shrinks the exposure from a whole `cargo test` to one API call rather than closing it. One bound rather than one per input: the stop is a property of a client-side re-read not being atomic with the act it precedes

### `repository-checks/files-no-capability-claims-a-stated-bound`

> a tracked file no capability's declared subject claims

- **because**: subjects are declared where a capability has something to say, and requiring them to tile the repository would buy coverage with a claim per capability that nobody could defend. The join reports how many tracked paths went unclaimed, so a clean verdict is not read as a complete one

### `repository-checks/the-consumer-stands-on-a-later-statement-a-stated-bound`

> an always-`Some` value bound to a name and read as if it could be absent on a later statement

- **because**: the reader joins a chain `rustfmt` broke and decides one logical line, so a consumer reached through a binding is outside what it can see. Following the binding is name resolution, which no reader over text performs. Measured when this was written: no site in the tree binds a `split(..).next()` and consumes it later

### `repository-checks/whether-a-mention-compiles-anything-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> a promised prelude member the external contract names only in a comment

- **because**: the check asks whether the promise was noticed at all, and deciding that a mention is load-bearing is a judgement over text this repository has designed, measured and rejected. What makes a mention bite is the compiler; a comment-only mention still fails the reviewer reading the diff, which is the layer that owns it

> a `because` quoting 三儀 ⊥ 三儀 and then stating that it does not bind that dimension
