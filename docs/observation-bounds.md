# Observation bounds

Every **observation bound** this family declares: a claim that a reaction deliberately stops at a
named shape, so that shape is governed policy rather than a defect.

**27 of 105 declared bounds have no pinning test.** That figure is the register's
audit backlog and leads the document because a number in a footnote is not read. Each such bound names
the tracker that owns closing it.

Generated from `openspec/specs/*/spec.md` by `crates/kanhe/tests/bound_register.rs`. **Do not edit by hand** —
regenerate with `BLESS=1 TIANHENG_WORKSPACE_TESTS=1 cargo test -p kanhe --test bound_register`. A stale projection fails that gate.

**What this document does not claim.** It lists the bounds the specs *state in a recognizable form*: a
scenario whose heading marks it a bound. The undeclared-prose direction that keeps this list honest has known
residuals and a deliberate exemption, each stated in this document rather than left in the check's
comments, because a residual a reader cannot see is one the register is lying about:

1. **Unrecognized wording.** A bound worded outside the scanned form — "out-of-scope", "does not claim
   to observe", "a stated, inherited bound" — is invisible to the scan.
2. **The scan is line-oriented.** A statement whose bound names continue onto the next line is examined
   only on the line carrying the trigger words.
3. **A reference clears more than it names.** `(bound: …)` clears the prose it sits with regardless of
   how many bounds that prose states, or whether the bound it names is one of them. This is how a
   retired `#[path]` bound survived two sweeps inside a sentence listing four inherited bounds behind
   one reference to a fifth. The discipline is one reference per stated bound, and it is the author's:
   closing it would mean reading which bounds a sentence lists, which no repository check can do. Scanning
   paragraphs instead of lines was measured against that defect and would not have caught it, because
   the paragraph carries the same clearing reference.

The **exemption**: prose under a requirement whose heading names bounds is not reported, because several
such requirements state their bounds as a numbered list, and requiring each item to become its own
scenario would restructure them and read worse. Its price
is charged — such a requirement must declare at least one bound scenario — but the other items of its
list are unregistered, which is why this list is a floor rather than a proof of completeness.

The second floor is the same shape. A bound declared twice is caught only when both declarations cite
the **same pinning test**, which is a fact rather than a heuristic; two declarations of one behaviour
citing two different tests are invisible. Telling those apart from two genuine bounds over sibling
shapes is a semantic judgment — two operand dimensions here declare identically-worded bounds over
`dyn` and `impl Trait`, each defended by its own test, and each must declare its own — so nothing
observes it and no bound of the register capability claims it.

A third floor was stated here for one change and is **retired**: a `pinned by` line could be satisfied
by a definition that never ran — commented out, inside a string, removed by a `cfg`, or trapped in an
uninvoked macro — because the scan read only the form of a line. Test-ness is now decided by the test
harness enumeration, which registers none of those. The weakness survives only in the source-text
fallback used where no manifest exists, which the register spec describes.


## crate-dependency-boundary

### `crate-dependency-boundary/an-optional-dependency-edge-is-observed-as-a-declared-one-a-stated-bound`

> that edge is governed exactly as an unconditional one, a stated bound: the rules read the **declared** dependency set, cargo reports an optional edge in that set like any other, and no rule can express *depends on this only when that feature is on*. A boundary therefore cannot say that an edge is confined to a non-default feature, and a reason that claims it would be asserting structure no rule observes. Where that distinction matters, the reaction is a build of the feature-off configuration — outside this capability — and the split belongs in the manifest's own `[features]` prose

## observation-bound-register

### `observation-bound-register/which-member-holds-a-check-is-a-judgement-a-stated-bound`

> nothing observes whether it landed in the right one. The split is by what a check judges — the law and the delivered product on one side, this repository's record on the other — and two mechanical rules were each measured unreliable: a text scan reads a comment naming `AGENTS.md` as governance while a check scanning every tracked file names nothing, and the workspace marker means both "this needs the repository as its subject" and "this needs a fixture". Position is the declaration; the join below catches a **capability** named wrongly, never a member chosen wrongly

- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *which governance member a check belongs to is unobserved*

### `observation-bound-register/whether-a-citation-demonstrates-the-direction-its-bound-declares-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts. `Extent::demonstrates()` names the direction a defence must show, and it reaches the projection's label and the contradiction classification beside it; no reader compares that prediction with what the cited test asserts. Reaching further means deciding what a test demonstrates from its source, which is a judgement over code of the same kind this repository has designed, measured and rejected over prose — and unlike a citation that never runs or never bites, there is no reaction here whose gap a fixture could exhibit. This is the sibling of *a rationale that contradicts its extent*, one step over: the prose beside an extent is already declared free to disagree with it, and so, until now silently, was the test beneath it

- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *a pin may defend a direction its bound does not declare*

### `observation-bound-register/what-code-executed-inside-the-checkout-does-outside-it-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts. Running the cited test is the reaction's whole method, so code execution inside the checkout is granted unconditionally, and neither consequence is separable from it: the shared common directory is what makes a git-reading citation reachable at all, and re-checking a resolved path after the build would re-check the same window that defeated it. Hooks are the one case that IS closed, because those run without any citation asking for them

### `observation-bound-register/whether-a-cited-test-s-outcome-depends-on-its-run-count-is-not-observed-beyond-one-period-a-stated-bound`

> the citation is reported as exercised by a perturbation that did nothing. The reaction runs the test a fixed number of times, so any period matching that sequence escapes it, and the number is readable in the reaction's own source. Closing it needs each run to be unable to observe how many times the test has run — a separate checkout per run — whose cost grows with the coverage this capability exists to grow

- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *most pinning citations have never been seen to fail*

### `observation-bound-register/whether-a-pin-gutted-but-not-committed-still-bites-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts, because the checkout under test is HEAD's content. The sibling gates read the worktree for exactly this reason, and this reaction cannot: mutating the author's checkout is what a separate checkout exists to avoid, so the two properties are in tension and this one is given up deliberately

> the pin fails and the citation is counted as exercised, because a killed pin does not say what killed it. Separating the two by refusing a record that edits its pin's file was measured against this tree's own first record, which legitimately edits the file its pin lives in, so the rule would refuse a conforming shape

## observer-protocol

### `observer-protocol/whether-the-shell-makes-an-independent-semantic-decision-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts — a stated bound, and a declared false negative this repository owns. A text reader over the composition body was built, hardened across four review rounds and defeated at every level: name resolution, the parameter's binding site, the identity of the definition, the caller frame, and execution, which no reading of text reaches at all. Invoking the observer made the two paths' *equality* construction-held and left this untouched: a guard written above that call compiles, passes the whole suite, and passes every gate — measured on the tree that invokes the observer, not on the one that did not. The bound carries no pinning test because there is no reaction left to demonstrate a gap in; it is tracked instead

- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *the shell's semantic delegation, held by construction*

### `observer-protocol/a-whole-line-occurrence-that-is-not-the-definition-anchors-the-read-a-stated-bound`

> the reaction reads that copy's body and reports it as the method's. Both anchor conditions are satisfied — one occurrence, at a line start — and the reader knows nothing of comments or literals, so the class is "the unique whole-line occurrence is not the definition" rather than any one syntactic position. What passes is a **second, hand-maintained path that agrees today**: a *divergent* list does not, because `observation-bound-model` reads every dimension's declarations through `Observer::bounds` and holds them in a bijection with the specs, which fails on any difference of membership or content. Measured both ways. So the residual is narrower than a divergent list slipping through, and wider than a comment. **Not a defect unique to this reader.** `kanhe::region`'s own `Executed` abstraction declares the identical residue for the same reason — a block comment and a string literal both need nested-span lexing to tell from executed text, which this tree has defeated repeatedly and left declared rather than approximated. Closing either needs the same instrument; closing one without the other would leave the class recorded twice under two names for a reader to reconcile. This bound SHALL be **shown rather than described**: the reaction enumerates every shape it decides together with the decision, the reader is run against that table, and the rows where it reads a body that is not the method's are this bound. A sentence here that the table contradicts fails, which is what the three repair rounds preceding this scenario could not do

- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *the bounds-method reader anchors on a whole-line occurrence that is not the definition*

### `observer-protocol/a-trait-object-on-a-wrapped-signature-s-continuation-line-is-not-seen-a-stated-bound`

> the reaction does not see it, a stated bound: the recognizer is handed one line at a time, so the continuation is never a candidate it declined — it is text the observation never presents. Closing it needs 渾儀 watching this crate, which the same measurement above found unavailable. Multi-line public signatures exist here, so the shape is live even where no instance names a trait object

### `observer-protocol/whether-an-observer-s-declared-bounds-are-complete-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

### `observer-protocol/whether-an-observer-s-own-verdict-is-correct-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

### `observer-protocol/what-a-subject-does-not-establish-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts.

## publish-source-integrity

### `publish-source-integrity/the-tree-changing-after-the-gate-passed-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts. The gate is one process and the act is another, and the wrapper holds no handle that ties them: `cargo publish` takes no argument naming the commit it must package, so there is no `--match-head-commit` to pin what was judged, which is what closes the equivalent window for the commit set on the merge path. What narrows it is `cargo publish`'s own refusal of a dirty worktree, which is a weaker property than the gate's — a tree amended and committed is clean again and packages a different commit under the same tag. The wrapper `cd`s once and `exec`s, so the window is two statements wide rather than a whole `cargo test`, and narrowing is all it can do

### `publish-source-integrity/whether-the-tag-s-signer-is-authorized-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> the gate accepts it, a stated bound: validity is verifiable without configuration and **attribution is not**, needing an allowed-signers file that exists on a maintainer's machine and not in CI. The ownership is inherited from the verification environment rather than held by this engine, because no change to this gate closes it — giving CI an allowed-signers file is what would

### `publish-source-integrity/whether-a-worktree-holding-an-undecodable-path-is-clean-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> the cleanliness judgement is never reached: the worktree read refuses as a cannot-judge, so the gate answers neither *clean* nor *dirty* for that tree. The stop is the reader's representation and not a choice this gate makes over the path — a verdict is not owed on an input it cannot represent, and every comparison the judgement would make downstream would be against a name the repository does not hold. What it costs is that such a repository cannot be published through the wrapper until the path is renamed or removed, which is a refusal in front of an irreversible act rather than a pass over one

## reference-integrity

### `reference-integrity/the-duration-phrase-in-non-record-markdown-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts, because that phrase alone is the group a reader over text cannot separate: it is as often **duration** — *admitted it for a window*, narrating how long something lasted — as it is a pointer at a moving window, and telling the two apart is a judgement about the sentence, which is the prose instrument `AGENTS.md` records as designed, measured three times and rejected. It is the same ground on which *the same window* is absent from the declared phrases entirely

### `reference-integrity/a-code-span-shaped-like-an-object-is-refused-though-it-names-none-a-stated-bound`

> the reaction fails anyway. It decides by **shape**, and nothing in the tree distinguishes a value of that shape from a citation without resolving it against an object database

- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *a code span shaped like an object that names none*

### `reference-integrity/an-abbreviation-carrying-no-letter-or-no-digit-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts. The reader requires **both** a letter and a digit, and the two directions it refuses without that requirement are both live in this tree: a specification writes a long run of digits as the figure a fabricating reader produced, and English carries words spelled entirely from the hex alphabet at this length. Admitting either would refuse a passage that cites nothing

### `reference-integrity/a-path-already-wrong-when-a-dated-record-was-written-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts, and nothing ever will. The exemption is by section, not by whether the path was once right, and distinguishing the two needs the tree as it stood at that date — a per-section historical checkout this check does not make and whose cost is not proportionate to a mistyped path in a frozen record. The engine owns the narrowing: it is this check's rule that declines to look, not a limit an adopter chose

### `reference-integrity/a-rust-identifier-named-in-prose-is-not-resolved-a-stated-bound`

> nothing reacts, and no reader of text can make it. Such tokens routinely match no declaration anywhere in the tree, and the most frequent of those are Rust keywords (`use`, `mod`, `dyn`, `fn`, `impl`), attribute names (`cfg_attr`) and std method names (`create_new`, `strip_prefix`, `remove_dir_all`). Telling a name that should resolve from one that should not needs type information about a receiver, which `inline-symbol-path-confinement` already declares unobserved.

The comparison is component-wise and case-sensitive on every host, so the answer is the same everywhere and is only *right* where the filesystem is case-sensitive.

### `release-coherence/prose-about-the-marker-is-read-as-a-marker-a-stated-bound`

> the section is classified as breaking and required to carry a `### Migration` it does not owe. The reaction reads the marker's presence rather than its position, and that reach is kept deliberately: over-reaction is the safe direction, while a positional matcher would stop observing a real break whose marker sits anywhere but an entry's first token — buying a false negative in the floor to remove a refusal an author can argue with.

What is refused is the **repair**, not the diagnosis — rewriting a dated section to satisfy a rule written afterwards would falsify the record, the same reason `docs/history/` is left alone — so this is a declared false negative with an owner rather than a shape that is harmless. Closing it needs a repair that adds to the record instead of editing it. **The WHEN was wider than the reason, and the gap was live.** It read *a dated section*, so the section the current release is still being written into was exempt too — where no record exists to falsify, and where release-ready state requires `[Unreleased]` to be empty, leaving the check with no subject at all during preparation.

### `repository-checks/a-construction-shape-the-register-s-reader-does-not-model-a-stated-bound`

> the reference is read as a construction, whichever it actually names. **The floor is name resolution and nothing narrower, and a real parser is what keeps it there.** A text scan over Rust is not exhaustive over the language: a byte char literal, a raw string, or a closure whose parameter list spans two lines desynchronises a character-by-character scan entirely, producing a site such a reader neither parses nor counts as unparseable — invisible to both of its readings at once, which is the unsafe direction, since a missed citation fails loud while a missed construction reports clean over a site nothing holds. Reading this repository's own Rust with a real parser closes that floor: every syntactically valid construction is seen by construction, not by an arm added the day a shape was found wrong. **What remains is not lexical.** Whether a bare reference names the constructor taken by value or a local variable that happens to share its spelling is not written down anywhere a parse tree carries — answering it needs name resolution, which a reader of syntax alone does not have

- **unpinned**, tracked by: `BACKLOG.md` — *a bare reference to a registered constructor's name cannot be told from a local variable sharing its spelling without name resolution*

### `repository-checks/a-refusal-constructed-outside-the-register-s-corpus-is-not-triaged-a-stated-bound`

> nothing triages it. The register reads `crates/kanhe/src`, and a construction there is either held by a direction or declared unheld; a construction beside its own directions is neither, because *which direction observes this branch* has no answer when every direction in the file can see it. Reaching further means deciding what a file that is both judgement and test is being asked, which is a question about where those gates should live rather than about this register

### `repository-checks/a-marker-is-reached-through-some-other-primitive-a-stated-bound`

> the reaction reports nothing. Those four are in live use for reading a *single* delimited value rather than pairing a sequence, and none of their live uses is a pairing — so refusing them by name would refuse the honest use, and telling the two apart needs the expression's shape rather than the primitive's name. Which is what the parity scenario above does for the one shape where the expression settles it: a count modulo two is a pairing whatever primitive produced the count

> the reaction reports nothing. It joins a chain `rustfmt` broke and reads one logical line, so a consumer reached through a binding is outside what a line-scoped reader can decide; following the binding is name resolution, which no reader over text performs.

> the sweep does not match it, a stated bound: the word reader covers the units, the tens, and one compound of the two, which stops at ninety-nine. Extending it upward buys nothing measurable — the figures this repository writes in words are the small ones, and a set large enough to need three-digit words is one whose prose writes digits. The residual is stated rather than closed because a word reader that silently stops matching reads as covered, which is the failure this requirement's own sweep exists to refuse

This repository's Rust sources carry census phrases **as fixture input**, where the figures are a parser's expected output and deliberately arbitrary; admitting them would report a test asserting its own parser as a drifted document. The narrow corpus is what keeps the sweep's every report actionable, and the residual is a figure in a code comment, which `AGENTS.md` measured and left to the reviewer

### `repository-checks/a-check-that-should-distinguish-a-region-and-does-not-a-stated-bound`

> no reaction sees either. An absence is not a shape, and nothing can scan for a filter that was never written; a disagreement between two scans is visible only to something that can already recognize what a region decision is, which is the same reaction. A reaction refusing an inline region decision was designed and measured against this repository: of the sites carrying the marker, only some are this class — the rest select commentary deliberately or parse a data format whose syntax marks comments — so it would refuse more legitimate sites than defects, which is how a gate earns being turned off. The classifier's adoption is what narrows this, and the narrowing is not a closure. The bound is declared on the construction rather than on an instance: a candidate one was reported and **refuted by measurement**, and a bound resting on a refuted instance would be worse than none

### `repository-checks/a-tool-configuration-set-in-the-environment-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`

Closing it is ordinary work here rather than another layer's, since the wrapper could scrub the environment before invoking the tool; it needs an allowlist **over the environment**, and legitimate setups export `CARGO_HOME` and `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, so which set to admit is a decision this bound records instead of guessing

### `repository-checks/a-gate-reached-without-the-wrapper-a-stated-bound`

> no repository check fires. Both assertions guard the sanctioned path; reaching further would mean observing the operator's shell or GitHub's servers rather than this repository. The pinning check narrows this without closing it: it keeps the sanctioned path sanctioned, so what is left is choosing not to use it rather than using it unguarded

### `repository-checks/an-input-edited-inside-its-own-post-gate-re-read-a-stated-bound`

> nothing observes it, and the merge proceeds against the value the gate approved. What the merge records is pinned by construction — the body travels as the value the gate judged, and the commit set through `--match-head-commit`, which GitHub decides atomically. `gh` offers no equivalent for the title, the base or the head branch's name, so each can only be re-read, which shrinks the exposure from a whole `cargo test` to one API call rather than closing it. Closing it needs a server-decided precondition this tool does not offer

Whether a value names `git` is not decidable from the line that constructs it, and a detector keyed on how a spawn is written is the shape `gate_exit_classes`' own header records being one form short three rounds running. Measured across the tracked Rust: two sites take a program as a value, and one of them **is** the builder every other read is routed through while the other names an `ssh-keygen` signature verifier.
