# Published-artifact provenance

What commit each published version of the family actually names, and where that disagrees with the
tag. Recorded because the disagreements are **permanent**: `cargo publish` writes the sha1 of whatever
`HEAD` it ran on into every tarball's `.cargo_vcs_info.json`, and a version can never be re-uploaded.
Nothing here is repairable — it is inventoried so a reader verifying a published crate against this
repository is not left to rediscover it, and so the two mechanisms that produced it are named rather
than re-learned.

`main` as the only publish source is now a reaction — `crates/kanhe/tests/publish_source.rs`, reached
through `scripts/publish.sh` (see *Branching and release* in `AGENTS.md`). This record is the state
that reaction was written against.

## The inventory is closed at `0.5.0`

**A commit sha1 does not belong in this repository, and the reason is its timing and its price.** The sha1
exists only *after* the upload that records it, so a committed copy is structurally late — it cannot be
written before the act, and the branch that would carry it is archived at the release squash, so it arrives
one release behind the thing it describes. And the price of writing forty hexadecimal characters is a
branch, a pull request, a full CI run and a squash merge. `0.5.0`'s row was paid for exactly that way.

What it buys is a **second copy of a permanent record**. The premise of this whole document is that
`cargo publish` writes the sha1 into the tarball and a version can never be re-uploaded: the registry holds
it, unalterably, for as long as the crate exists. Re-typing it here caches a value that is already
canonical somewhere else, and the cache is the half that can go stale.

So the table stops here. Its rows stay: they are a real audit of the era **before** the publish-source
reaction existed, and the *verdicts* in them — which disagreement, and which mechanism produced it — are
judgements that took an audit to establish rather than figures anyone can look up.

**Nothing replaces the table, because the question was always answerable without it.** *Reproducing the
audit* below is not a way to rebuild this table; it is the standing way to ask what any published version
records, at any time, from the two places that hold the answer. A reader who wants `0.6.0`'s provenance runs
it rather than looking for a row.

One consequence is stated rather than left to be discovered: the mechanism this reaction **cannot** prevent
is a release snapshot force-pushed away *after* a clean publish, as `0.2.2` was an hour later. A row appended
at publish time never catches that — at publish time the gate has just passed — so per-release rows were
never the instrument for it. Re-running the audit later is.

## Inventory

Audited 2026-08-05 across **all 96 published tarballs** then on the books — every version of `xuanji`,
`guibiao`, `hunyi`, `louke`, `tianheng`, and `xingbiao` (which joined at `0.1.6`, so `0.1.0`–`0.1.5` have five
crates rather than six). `0.5.0`'s six were audited separately on 2026-08-28, the day they were published, by
the same command below; the earlier rows are not re-derived here, and the scope line says which audit covered
what rather than letting one date stand for both. Within every single version the recorded commit is
**identical across all of its crates**, so the inventory is per version: each release was one publish run from
one checkout.

## The two mechanisms

They are genuinely different, and only one of them is what the publish-source gate refuses.

### Publishing from somewhere other than the tagged `main` commit — `0.4.0`

`f1dba52` is the tip of `release/0.4.0` (`chore(release): prepare 0.4.0`), not `e645a549`, the
`release: 0.4.0` commit on `main` that `v0.4.0` tags. The publish ran from the release branch's
checkout instead of from `main` after the squash.

**No published content is affected.** The two commits have the same tree hash
(`458ffeb53be919f39fab9c90a0aeea655f32c3c9`), every crate's subtree hash matches, and every shipped
tracked file in all six tarballs is byte-identical to `main` — including each `Cargo.toml.orig`. The
only differences are the three files cargo generates (the normalized `Cargo.toml`, the per-crate
`Cargo.lock`, and `.cargo_vcs_info.json` itself). This is precisely what makes the class easy to miss:
cargo records the **commit**, not the content, so an identical tree does not make a release branch's
tip an acceptable source.

`f1dba52` remains resolvable — `release/0.4.0` is retained on the remote, as every release branch back
to `release/0.2.0` is. It is anchored by no tag, deliberately: enshrining a permanent ref outside
protected `main` would contradict the rule this record exists to support.

This is the class `crates/kanhe/tests/publish_source.rs` refuses. Run against a worktree at `f1dba52` it
exits `1`; against `main` it exits `0`.

### A published release snapshot amended afterwards — `0.2.2`

`993c82b1` is *also* a `release: 0.2.2` commit, its parent `1df44f97` being `main`'s `release: 0.2.1`,
GitHub-verified, committed `2026-07-22T00:41:29Z`. So `0.2.2` **was** published from `main`'s release
snapshot; the source was right at the time. About an hour and forty minutes later `main` was
force-pushed with a sibling snapshot, `38319262` (`2026-07-22T02:22:45Z`, same parent), and `v0.2.2`
tags that one instead. The published pointer was orphaned after the fact, not misdirected.

The two trees differ in exactly **four files**, all inside one since-pruned change directory,
`2026-07-21-cleanup-louke-phantom-tests`, under `openspec/changes/archive/` — the release-baseline
archive pruning. All 225 remaining blobs are identical. None of those four is inside a crate
directory, and
`cargo publish` packages only files within each crate's own directory, so **no published crate content
differs either**.

`993c82b1` is absent from a fresh clone's object store but still resolves through the GitHub API,
which is the only reason this could be reconstructed at all.

**The rule this yields:** once a version is on crates.io, its `release: X.Y.Z` commit is immutable.
Amending or force-pushing it away orphans a pointer that can never be rewritten. The publish-source
gate cannot see this coming — at publish time the check passed — so this half stays a convention, with
a post-hoc audit (comparing each published version's recorded sha against its tag) as the reaction it
would take. That audit is not built: it needs network access and a recorded baseline for every
anomaly above, and no second occurrence has been observed.

### `0.1.0`–`0.1.10` — unknowable

All eleven recorded commits return `422 No commit found` from the GitHub API: they were orphaned by the
2026-07-17 history rewrite and repository re-creation, which re-signed every commit and therefore
changed every sha1. Whether those eleven publishes ran from `main` **can no longer be determined**, and
no artifact or ref survives from which to determine it. They are listed for completeness, not as
findings. Their tags were lightweight and unsigned until 2026-08-05, when all eleven were re-created as
signed annotated tags pointing at their own unchanged commits.

## Asking the question of any version

Read-only, and it answers from the two places that hold the answer rather than from the table above — which
is why the table could stop growing. For one version, published or about to be:

```bash
crate=xuanji version=0.4.0
curl -sL -o pkg.crate "https://static.crates.io/crates/$crate/$crate-$version.crate"
tar -xOzf pkg.crate "$crate-$version/.cargo_vcs_info.json"  # -> {"git":{"sha1":"…"},"path_in_vcs":…}
git rev-list -n 1 "v$version"                               # the commit the tag names
```

A recorded commit missing from the local object store may still resolve on the remote:
`gh api repos/tacticaldoll/tianheng/commits/<sha1>`. Comparing two trees without fetching either is
`gh api "repos/tacticaldoll/tianheng/git/trees/<tree-sha>?recursive=1"` on both and diffing the
`path`/`sha` pairs — which is how the four-file `0.2.2` difference above was established. Note that the
compare endpoint's `files` array is the wrong tool for two diverged commits: it reports the diff from
their merge base, so it presents everything the release added rather than how the two snapshots differ.
