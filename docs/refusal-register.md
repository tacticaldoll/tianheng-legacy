# Refusal register

Every refusal site in this repository, and what holds it. A site is registered by being constructed through `refusal::violation_at` or `refusal::cannot_judge_at`, and **held** by a direction calling `refusal::expect` with the same identity, compared by running rather than by reading a message.

**What this document does not claim.** `refusal::violation` and `refusal::cannot_judge` construct a refusal carrying no site identity — `Site::OutsideRegister` — so this register does not see them. Its corpus, `crates/kanhe/src`, holds **none** of them, which is the figure beside *carry no identity at all* above. The test targets do hold them, and this corpus excludes those: none is registered, held, or declared here, and whether any should have taken an identity is a judgement this document does not make. **No count of them is given**, and two different things stand in the way. One is a floor: a name taken by reference reads the same whether it is the constructor or a local that shares its spelling, and no reader of text can decide which. The other is a debt: whether an occurrence is inside a closure's parameter list is a **position**, and this reader answers it by counting the pipes standing before the name on its line — which is right for every shape the corpus holds and is an approximation of the position rather than the position itself. The first cannot be closed; the second can.

A site that no direction holds is **declared unheld**, with why, an owner and a tracker, in the table this register reads. There is no third state among *registered* sites: one is held or declared, and the register refuses anything else.

Generated from `crates/kanhe/src/**.rs` by `crates/kanhe/tests/refusal_register.rs`. **Do not edit by hand** — regenerate with `BLESS=1 TIANHENG_WORKSPACE_TESTS=1 cargo test -p kanhe --test refusal_register`. A stale projection fails that gate.

**20 of 148 refusal sites are declared unheld.** 0 carry no identity at all, which is a state this repository does not keep — the register refuses a non-zero figure here.

## Declared unheld

### `release-coherence#changelog-in-head-unreadable`

- because presence is asked by `ls-tree HEAD -- CHANGELOG.md`, which exits non-zero only where git cannot read HEAD's **tree** — and the judgement resolves HEAD and the release commit before it, through reads that fail first on any object store broken enough to reach this one. Measured: a fixture whose `.git/index` is corrupt leaves tree reads working, which is why the content read moved off `status` in the first place, and a fixture whose objects are gone fails at `rev-parse`. The blob half of the same question **is** observed, by `a_changelog_git_cannot_read_at_head_is_not_a_modified_worktree`, because a tree can name a blob git will not hand over
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#release-tag-unreadable`

- because measured, not assumed: every ref-store perturbation a fixture can build answers `1`, which is this read's ANSWER — an unreadable `refs/tags` and a `refs/tags` replaced by a file both exit `1`, and in that state `rev-parse HEAD` fails first at `128`, so the judgement never reaches this arm. The classifier itself IS observed, against a directory that is no repository; what no fixture can build is a repository whose earlier reads succeed and whose tag read declines
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#remote-tag-unreadable`

- because the sibling read of the same remote runs first: `ls-remote refs/heads/main` and `ls-remote refs/tags/<tag>` reach one transport by one command, so a remote a fixture can make unreadable answers the first read that way and returns before this one. Reaching this needs the remote to fail between two invocations, which a fixture would have to hold open — measured against the unreachable-remote direction, which lands on `remote-main-unreadable`
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#tag-object-unresolvable`

- because `rev-parse refs/tags/<tag>` runs after the tag's presence, its object and its signature have all been read from the same store, so a ref-store state that answers those and not this is one no fixture can build — the sibling `release-tag-unreadable` records the same measurement for the reads above it
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#directory-entry-unreadable`

- because a directory entry that errors while the directory itself enumerates is produced by the filesystem between two syscalls, and a fixture would have to hold that window open
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#metadata-has-no-workspace-root`

- because cargo emits `workspace_root` for every workspace it can load, so reaching this means replacing cargo with something that answers differently — the direction would then observe the replacement
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#metadata-package-has-no-manifest-path`

- because same corpus as its sibling above: a package cargo reports without a manifest path is not a shape cargo produces, so the fixture is a fake cargo
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#member-manifest-outside-workspace-root`

- because cargo resolves member paths against the root it reports, so a member outside it is a disagreement inside cargo rather than a shape a manifest can carry
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#member-manifest-has-no-directory`

- because `cargo metadata --no-deps` reports absolute manifest paths and every one of those has a parent, so a manifest with no directory is not a shape cargo produces. It is a site rather than a fold because the sibling above asserts the manifest is outside the root, which is false of a path that has no parent -- the two are repaired in different places
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#member-directory-not-utf8`

- because the manifest this reader spells is a `&str` cargo's JSON handed over, so the parser made its components UTF-8 before this gate saw them and no path built from one can carry a byte the decode refuses — the same arm reached from a filesystem walk IS observed, by `a_crate_directory_that_is_not_utf8_is_refused_by_the_walk`, which is where the bytes are the operating system's rather than a parser's
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#crate-manifest-outside-repository`

- because the manifest is joined onto `repo` in the same loop that strips it, so a walk output sitting outside `repo` is this reader disagreeing with itself rather than a tree a fixture can build — the sibling `member-manifest-outside-workspace-root` above records the same shape for the answer cargo gives, where the join is cargo's rather than this walk's
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#scripts-not-enumerable`

- because `git ls-files` failing while the same process already read the repository is a git failure mid-run, and simulating it means putting a fake git on the path
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#cargo-metadata-unrunnable`

- because cargo absent from the path of a process cargo is running
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `release-coherence#cargo-metadata-not-json`

- because cargo emitting something that is not JSON, which is a fake cargo by construction
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#repository-root-is-not-a-worktree`

- because git failing to *start*, as against git running and refusing — the refusing half is observed. Reaching this means a machine without git, and a fixture that removes git from the path tests the path manipulation
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#ssh-keygen-unavailable`

- because the same shape one tool over, and with the same fixture: `ssh-keygen` removed from the path
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#signature-mechanism-round-trip-failed`

- because the gate's own probe signs and verifies a payload before trusting its verdict; reaching this means an `ssh-keygen` that signs and then fails to verify its own signature
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#signature-block-unreadable`

- because git failing to read a tag object it has already resolved, mid-run
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#signature-is-not-the-tag-object-suffix`

- because a tag object whose signature block is not its own suffix is one git does not write, so the fixture would be a hand-assembled object testing this reader against that assembly
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*

### `publish-source-integrity#signature-unwritable`

- because a scratch directory this process created and cannot write to. Running as root defeats the fixture outright, which makes the direction's own result depend on who runs it
- owner: Engine
- tracked by `BACKLOG.md` — *a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed*
