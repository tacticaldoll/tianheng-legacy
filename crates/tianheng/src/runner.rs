//! The runner — the CI reaction, as a reusable library entry point.
//!
//! [`run`] turns a caller-supplied [`Constitution`] and the process arguments into
//! a process exit code, providing the whole `tianheng check` contract: flag parsing
//! (`--manifest-path`, `--baseline` / `--write-baseline`, `--format`), the baseline
//! gate and write actions, the human and JSON reports, and the exit-code mapping
//! (`0` clean / warn-only / fully baselined, `1` enforce violation, `2`
//! constitution / scan / usage error). An adopting project declares its own
//! constitution in Rust and gets this contract from one line:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tianheng::prelude::*;
//! fn constitution() -> Constitution { Constitution::new("my-project") }
//! fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode {
//!     tianheng::run(&constitution(), std::env::args())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! IO (filesystem, stdout/stderr) is quarantined here; the `guibiao` crate stays the
//! pure functional core (the model plus [`check`](crate::check)), and must not depend on
//! this shell — a crate-level invariant (see `crates/shengmo/src/law.rs`). The numeric
//! work lives in the private [`dispatch`], so the exit code is unit-testable; [`run`] is
//! a thin [`ExitCode`] wrapper.

/// The fsync before the rename is what makes the crash half of that true, and it is not
/// redundant with the rename's atomicity: `rename` is atomic with respect to *other observers*
/// (no one ever sees a half-swapped name), but it orders only the directory entry, never the
/// temp file's still-dirty data pages. Without the fsync, a crash shortly after a successful
/// rename can leave the baseline path present and empty — losing both the previous content and
/// the annotations merged into it, the exact loss the temp-then-rename exists to prevent. ext4
/// happens to paper over this for the replace-via-rename pattern via its `auto_da_alloc`
/// heuristic, but that is one filesystem's courtesy, disabled by `noauto_da_alloc` and absent
/// elsewhere; this crate ships to adopters on filesystems it does not choose, so the guarantee
/// is made explicitly rather than borrowed. The directory flush after the rename covers the
/// other half — that the swapped-in *name* survives — and is best-effort and unix-only, for the
/// reasons [`sync_parent_dir`] states: it strengthens a write that has already landed, so a
/// platform or filesystem that cannot flush a directory must not turn that write into a
/// reported failure.
///
/// The swap targets the file's symlink-resolved real path and carries over its existing
/// permissions: `rename` unconditionally replaces whatever sits at its destination, so renaming
/// onto `path` directly would silently replace a symlinked baseline with a plain file (orphaning
/// whatever the symlink pointed at) and reset the mode to the temp file's process-umask default,
/// silently widening permissions an adopter deliberately narrowed.
///
/// The temp file is opened with `create_new` (`O_EXCL`), never a plain create-or-truncate: a
/// predictable `<target>.tmp-<pid>` name that instead followed whatever already sat there would
/// let anything pre-planted at that path — a symlink included — receive the write and the
/// permission change that follows it, corrupting a file this process never intended to touch.
/// Measured directly: a symlink planted at the predicted temp path, right after the process was
/// launched, redirected the write and left the baseline's own path as a dangling symlink to the
/// victim. `create_new` refuses outright if anything already exists there, closing that off
/// entirely. Its mode is set to match the original file's at creation (`unix` only — permission
/// bits are not a portable concept), instead of created at the process umask default and narrowed
/// afterward — also measured: with a 0600 baseline, the temp file was briefly 0664 before the
/// follow-up `set_permissions` narrowed it.
///
/// That follow-up still has to run — `O_CREAT`'s mode is masked by the process umask, so it can only
/// *narrow*, and a baseline whose own mode is wider than the umask allows (0666 under umask 022)
/// would otherwise be silently published at 0644. It runs against the **open descriptor**
/// ([`std::fs::File::set_permissions`], an `fchmod`), never against the temp path. Applying it by
/// path would re-open the very race `create_new` was chosen to close, one step after closing it:
/// between the `O_EXCL` open and a path-based `chmod`, anything able to write the baseline's
/// directory — the same access the `create_new` reasoning above assumes — can unlink the temp file
/// and plant a symlink at that predictable name, and `chmod` follows it, stamping the baseline's mode
/// onto a file the attacker chose. A descriptor names the inode this process created, so there is no
/// second name lookup to win. Measured as the syscall, since the resulting mode is identical either
/// way and no test bound to it could tell the two apart: the path form issued
/// `chmod("<target>.tmp-<pid>", 0100666)`, the descriptor form issues `fchmod(4, 0100666)`.
///
/// The cleanup runs in [`AtomicTempFileGuard::drop`] and stays a `remove_file` of the temp path,
/// which is not the same exposure: `unlink` does not follow symlinks, so a symlink planted at that
/// name is itself what gets removed, never its target. The temp path is built by appending to the resolved
/// target's raw `OsString`, never through `Path::display()` (which lossily replaces non-UTF-8
/// bytes for human-readable formatting) — a resolved path is not guaranteed valid UTF-8, and a
/// lossy round-trip through a new string can point at a directory that does not exist, failing an
/// otherwise-valid overwrite outright. `create_new`'s `AlreadyExists` can only come from opening
/// the temp file itself — the step is split out from the rest so that outcome is reported as
/// [`BaselineWriteError::TempPathCollision`] (naming the temp path, not this process's io::Error
/// against the baseline path) rather than inferred from an error kind that could, if a later step
/// ever changed, silently stop meaning "this process created nothing." Any failure once the temp
/// file is open unconditionally cleans it up — no kind-based inference needed there, since opening
