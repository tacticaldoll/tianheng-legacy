//! Cross-dimension conformance for the one **transparent control-flow macro**, `cfg_if!`: its arms
//! wrap human-authored items without transforming their identities, so what an adopter writes inside
//! an arm is real, compiled code and every dimension that reads the file must observe it.
//!
//! One fixture body carries all three dimensions' constructs at once — a forbidden `use` (圭表's
//! observation), a forbidden public return type (渾儀's), and a declared seam's only probe (漏刻's) —
//! so the three cannot be pinned on separately-drifting inputs. Each dimension hand-writes its own
//! recognition of the macro (三儀 ⊥ 三儀: the same rule, never a shared scanner), which is exactly
//! why the ledger exists.
//!
//! Each joined after its own measured gap on this fixture shape. 圭表 gained transparency in 0.2.3.
//! 渾儀 handled no `syn::Item::Macro` at all: 圭表 exit 1, 渾儀 **exit 0** on the identical file — an
//! exposure false negative, the one bug class the core contract forbids. 漏刻 skipped a `cfg_if!`
//! body like any foreign macro in both of its passes, which broke two of its three reaction
//! directions in both error directions at once: a typo'd seam and an un-auditable probe inside an arm
//! escaped entirely, while a seam whose only real probe lived in an arm was reported **unprobed** — a
//! false alarm against coverage the adopter actually had.
//!
//! Exit codes are the claim; error wordings stay `errors_conformance.rs`'s concern.
