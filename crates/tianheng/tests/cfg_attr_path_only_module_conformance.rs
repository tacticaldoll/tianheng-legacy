//! Cross-dimension conformance for a module declared ONLY via one or more resolved
//! `#[cfg_attr(pred, path = "...")]` remaps — no plain conventional file (`imp.rs` /
//! `imp/mod.rs`) and no unconditional `#[path]`.
//!
//! 渾儀's `has_backing_source` walk (`crates/hunyi/src/scan/items.rs`) and 漏刻's own copy
//! (`crates/louke/src/audit/scan/probes.rs`) already tolerated this exact shape, treating a resolved
//! `cfg_attr(path)` candidate as legitimate grounds for the plain file's own absence. 圭表's own
//! module-boundary reachability walk (`crates/guibiao/src/module_scan/reachability/walk.rs`) did
//! not: it hard-errored ("source file could not be located", exit 2) on a declaration that
//! compiles cleanly under real rustc on every platform — a cross-dimension divergence since closed.
//! `crates/guibiao/tests/cfg_attr_path_only_module_absence.rs`
//! already pins 圭表 alone against the audited trigger and its corner cases; nothing had
//! previously fed the SAME shape to all three dimensions' real public entry points and asserted
//! they agree — this is that ledger, mirroring `dual_backed_module_conformance.rs`'s practice of
//! pinning every relevant outcome of a module-resolution rule, not only the happy one.
//!
//! Each dimension hand-writes its own resolution (三儀 ⊥ 三儀: no shared scanner code). Five
//! states are exercised: a stacked (per-platform) `cfg_attr(path)`-only declaration carrying a
//! violation, a single non-stacked `cfg_attr(path)`-only declaration carrying a violation (the fix
//! is not specific to "stacked"), a clean `cfg_attr(path)`-only declaration whose only probe lives
//! inside the remapped file, and the boundary the tolerance must NOT widen — every candidate
//! absent (no plain file, no resolved `cfg_attr(path)` target, no bare `#[cfg]`) — which must stay
//! a genuine constitution error (exit 2) in all three dimensions, never a silently-governed orphan.
//!
//! The fifth is the SIBLING shape, added after it drifted the same way: a `cfg_attr(path)` on an
//! **inline** `mod x { mod y; }`, where the remap names the base directory the body's file-form
//! children resolve from rather than a file to read. 漏刻's specification already required it and 圭表
//! did not — the identical divergence this ledger exists for, one shape over, found because nothing
//! fed THIS shape to all three entry points either. Closed by
//! `fix(guibiao): follow a conditional path remap on an inline mod to its children's base`; pinned
//! here so the class is closed rather than the instance.
//!
//! Exit codes are the claim; error wordings stay `errors_conformance.rs`'s concern.
