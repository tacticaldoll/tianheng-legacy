//! How this repository's checks spell a path below a root — one rule, one implementation.
//!
//! Every gate here that compares its own paths against git's, or against another reader's, has to turn an
//! absolute path cargo reported into the repository-relative identity git and this repository's prose both
//! use. `release_coherence_gate::machinery_names`, `release_coherence_gate::workspace_manifests` and
//! `member_enumeration`'s comparison all ask it, and they ask it here.
//!
//! **Two of them are the two sides of one comparison**, which is what makes a shared spelling load-bearing
//! rather than tidy: `member_enumeration` holds cargo's member set against the gate's walk as **strings**, so
//! a difference in how either renders a separator is a difference in every member. Written out per site, the
//! two disagreed — one joined components with `/` and the other used `Path::display`, the host's own
//! separator — and on a host where that separator is not `/` the two sets share no member at all. That state
//! is closed; the property it falsifies is why the derivation has one owner.
//!
//! **The separator is not a character here.** Cargo reports native paths, so stripping a `"{root}/"` string
//! rather than a prefix of components leaves every member outside the prefix wherever that separator is not
//! `/` — the defect `release_coherence_gate::machinery_names` records having already met. It is private,
//! so this is the prose form rather than the link form: a reference rustdoc cannot resolve is what
//! `reference-integrity` declares a bound for, and a link to a private item is one. The
//! result is joined back with `/` deliberately: it is compared against git's paths and cited in this
//! repository's own prose, both of which spell a separator that way whatever the host does.
