//! The squash-message judgement, shared by the gate and by its failure matrix.
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` states these rules and nothing held them: nine subjects, counted when this gate was written, carry a
//! trailing `(#N)`, the most recent on the commit that landed a check for a requirement enforced by
//! nothing. The rule cannot be held where rules are usually held here — a squash merge runs on GitHub's
//! servers, so no local commit exists and no `commit-msg` hook runs, and both values of
//! `squash_merge_commit_title` append the serial. What remains is one string passed at merge time.
//!
//! So this stands in front of `gh pr merge` the way the publish-source gate stands in front of
//! `cargo publish`: a rule that was written, then missed, at the one moment nothing can be undone. A merged
//! squash on a release branch is a record, and amending it would decouple it from the pull request whose
//! merge record cites its hash.
//!
//! The verdict is the shared kinded [`Refusal`], so *the message disagrees* stays separate from *the title
//! could not be read*. The focused failure matrix asserts both observable outcomes and their actionable text.
