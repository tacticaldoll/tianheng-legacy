//! Building the repositories this crate's gates are judged against — one owner, apart from the judgements.
//!
//! **A gate and the fixture that demonstrates it are two jobs.** `release_coherence_gate` and
//! `publish_source_gate` each held both, each behind a banner comment marking the seam, and
//! `hermetic_git` held a third piece of the same job beside its invocation forms. A banner is a
//! reader's note about a boundary; a module is the boundary. What the split buys is a place where the
//! shared primitives can live without either gate owning them — the state before it was that a helper
//! written for one fixture was reached for by the other only after someone noticed.
//!
//! **The direction runs one way and is meant to.** A fixture writes a shape its gate declares, so
//! `release_coherence` reads that gate's changelog-link constants; no gate reads anything here. The
//! judgement modules are the authority on the shapes, and these builders are consumers of them.
//!
//! **What stayed behind, and why it is not an exception.** `hermetic_git::fixture` asserts success
//! because its caller is building rather than judging — but that is a distinction among *invocation
//! forms*, which is what that module is: `run` trims for a caller reading a value, `run_exact` keeps
//! the bytes for one comparing content, `run_with_stdin` delivers records, and `fixture` panics. Moving
//! one member out would put two modules in charge of how a `git` is invoked here, which is the twin
//! drift this crate spends itself closing. `FIXTURE_DAY` stayed with it for the reason its own doc
//! gives: the owner of a stamp is the thing that stamps it, and `fixture` is what writes the date onto
//! a commit.
