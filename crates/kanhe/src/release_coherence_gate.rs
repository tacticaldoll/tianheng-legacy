    // them: at the release commit, writing the `[Unreleased]` entry that `Development` **requires** is judged
    // in `Snapshot`, where `[Unreleased]` must be **empty**. Measured on `release/0.6.0`'s first change — the
    // tree could not be made to pass until it was committed, because committing is what moved `head`.
    //
    // **The CHANGELOG is what carries the cycle, so it is what decides.** A first attempt asked whether
    // *anything* tracked was modified, and two existing directions refuted it: a fixture whose `Cargo.lock`
    // has been replaced by a directory is a **broken release checkout**, not the next cycle beginning, and
    // classifying it as `Development` made it refuse for a missing `[Unreleased]` entry before it could
    // report the lockfile it cannot read. The directions were right and the wider rule was wrong.
    //
    // What distinguishes the two states is exactly what this repository's own requirement names: *active
    // development SHALL retain the current released version and at least one changelog list item under
    // `[Unreleased]`*. Writing that item is how a cycle begins, and it is a change to this file. Untracked
    // files are excluded — this gate reads named tracked paths, so a file it never opens decides nothing.
    // **Read from the object database, not the index.** `git status` was the first spelling and it took a
    // WHEN that belonged to another guard: an existing direction corrupts `.git/index` to make the machinery
    // enumeration fail, and a `status` here intercepted it — measured, that direction stopped reaching its
    // own site. `git show HEAD:…` reads the tree, so the same corrupt index leaves it working, also measured.
    //
    // `hermetic_git::run` trims trailing whitespace from git's output, so the committed text arrives without
    // its final newline while `read` keeps one. Measured: every snapshot direction in the corpus failed on
    // that difference alone before the two sides were compared on the same footing, which is why the exact
    // read is used here.
    //
    // **Presence is asked first, by a command whose exit status answers it.** `git show HEAD:…` exits `128`
    // for a path that is not in HEAD *and* for a tree it cannot read, so a single `Err` arm had to choose one
    // meaning for both — and choosing *not a snapshot* classified a broken object store as the next cycle.
    // Measured on this machine's git: `ls-tree HEAD -- <path>` exits `0` with an empty listing when the path
    // is absent, `0` with a line when it is there, and `128` only when the tree cannot be read. The question
