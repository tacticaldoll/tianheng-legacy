//! An input a wrapper hands a gate across the process boundary, in each state it can be in.
//!
//! A gate that stands in front of an irreversible act is run by a wrapper, and its inputs arrive as
//! environment. `std::env::var` answers **not set** and **set but not UTF-8** with one `Err`, which is the
//! absent-versus-unreadable collapse this crate draws everywhere else: `WorkspaceVersion`,
//! `PackageName`, `Declared`, `Package`, `Tracked`, `Failure` and `Site` all carry it inside `src`.
//!
//! **It was drawn for every judged input of one gate but one**, and the one left out was the one whose
//! absence means *no merge is being made*. So a subject the wrapper supplied as bytes the gate could not read
//! took the arm that returns clean, the run exited `0`, `require_one_pass` saw `1 passed`, and
//! `exec gh pr merge` recorded a subject no judgement had read — the one outcome the Core Contract forbids,
//! in front of a record that cannot be amended. Two spellings of one rule is what let the repair that closed
//! the others stop one line short of it.
//!
//! One reader, one typed result, and consumers that match exhaustively: a further input cannot now be added
//! under a different rule, because there is no second rule to add it under. The set has grown since, which is
//! the property that matters here rather than its size.
