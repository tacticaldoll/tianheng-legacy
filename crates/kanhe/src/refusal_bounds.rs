//! The refusal sites this repository declares **unheld**: reached by no direction, and deliberately so.
//!
//! A refusal is normally held by a direction that observes it, and the refusal register refuses a registered
//! site nothing names. This is the third state, and it exists because forcing the second would be worse
//! than the gap it closes.
//!
//! **The distinction is not difficulty, it is what the fixture would test.** A refusal about the judged
//! *subject* — a manifest cargo accepts, a tag that exists, a changelog someone wrote — has a fixture that
//! *is* its specification, and neutralising the branch lets a real defect reach a release. A refusal about
//! the *reading* failing — a tool that will not run, a directory that will not enumerate, output that is not
//! JSON — can only be reached by breaking the machine, so its fixture must simulate the broken tool. A
//! fixture that simulates a tool tests the simulation: it can pass while the branch it names is wrong, which
//! is a false green, and a false green is worse than a declared gap.
//!
//! The split is not a judgement made here. Every site in this table is a **cannot-judge**, and the compiler
//! said so before anyone claimed it: with the last subject-class refusal registered, `violation` became an
//! unused import in the release gate.
//!
//! **The escape hatch is not free.** A declaration is typed, counted, projected, and carries an owner and a
//! tracker; the register holds this table and the sites in a bijection, refuses a declared site that a
//! direction *does* observe — that one is held, and should say so — and requires the count of untriaged
//! sites to be **zero**. What this table cannot do is decide its own membership, which stays a reviewer's
//! obligation, stated here rather than implied by a list that looks complete.
