//! The manifest facts both git-reading gates ask for, with one implementation each.
//!
//! **The same pair of files, and the same lesson, as [`crate::hermetic_git`].** That module's own doc says
//! the command builder "lived twice, byte-identical, in `publish_source_gate` and `release_coherence_gate`
//! … what two implementations of one thing cost". Two more twins were left behind in that extraction —
//! *which version the workspace declares*, and *is this a semantic version* — and unlike the pair that was
//! taken, **these two had diverged**:
//!
//! | fact | publish gate | coherence gate |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | workspace version | also accepted a `[package]` table | `[workspace.package]` only |
//! | semver | a digit check, so `1.0.99999999999999999999` passed | parsed to `u64`, so it did not |
//!
//! Two readers of one fact reaching different verdicts, in front of `cargo publish`.
//!
//! # The `[package]` fallback is not carried forward
//!
//! It was unreachable for every subject either gate has, measured rather than assumed: this repository's
//! root declares `[workspace.package]` and no `[package]`, and both gates' own fixtures write
//! `[workspace.package]` too. Keeping it would have preserved an untested branch to settle a disagreement
//! that no input could produce.
//!
//! A single-crate root now reads as *no workspace version*, which both callers already treat as a
//! cannot-judge. That is the right direction for a wrapper whose publish is `--workspace`: a root with no
//! workspace table is not the shape either gate was written to judge, and saying so beats guessing.
