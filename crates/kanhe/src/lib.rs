//! 勘合 (Kānhé) — the split tally.
//!
//! A 勘合 is one document made in two halves, kept apart, and proven genuine by fitting them back
//! together. Every repository check in this crate does that:
//! `AGENTS.md` against `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `CHANGELOG.md` against the tree it describes, a
//! spec's declared bound against the test that defends it, a generated document against the
//! generator its own header names.
//!
//! It is **not** 校讎. That word is already spent: 校讎 is one of the 三司 and names the *amendment
//! flow* — the steward routing, and the amendment itself — while this crate collates a record. A first
//! draft of this crate took the name anyway, which is the misnaming its own siblings exist to end.
//!
//! It is **not** self-governance either. 繩墨 holds the law 天衡 declares over itself and the dogfood gates that
//! run the delivered product's reactions against this workspace; what lives here judges the repository's
//! *record*. It **reads** the product's declared surface where a record is held against it — the bound
//! register, the prelude promise, the observer protocol — and where it runs a product reaction over this
//! workspace it does so with the **workspace as its subject**, to compare two composition paths for
//! equality over a non-trivial input. It never runs one to *enforce* the law over this workspace, which is
//! 繩墨's. The two ask different questions through the same call, and that is the line. Keeping them apart
//! is the point: a claim about one was read as a claim about both for as long as they shared a directory.
//!
//! **That sentence has now been wrong twice, in the paragraph declaring the split.** It said *reaches no
//! product contract at all* until a review read it against the manifest — the `tianheng` edge and its
//! consumers in `src/` arrived after the paragraph and nothing re-read it. Its replacement said *runs no
//! product reaction against this workspace*, and the next review found `observer_protocol` calling
//! `tianheng::check_constitution` over this workspace's own manifest. Both repairs removed a false absolute
//! and wrote another without sweeping the crate for it. Nothing resolves a boundary sentence here, which is
//! why reading is what has caught both.
//!
//! Like 繩墨 it ships in no package, and for the same reason.
//!
//! # What lives where
//!
//! - **`src/`** — the judgements: what a squash message must be, what a release section must say,
//!   where a refusal may be constructed.
//! - **`src/tests/`** — their failure matrices, as unit tests beside what they test.
//! - **`tests/`** — the repository checks: what runs against the real repository.
