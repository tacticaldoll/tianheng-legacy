/// | global / system config file | yes |
/// | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore` | yes — see below; this row read **no** until a gate was found relying on it |
/// | `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` + `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n` / `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n` | **yes** — by occupying index 0; this row read **no** until it was measured |
/// | `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` | **yes** — cleared, see `CONFIG_CHANNELS` below; a channel parallel to the count, which occupying index 0 does nothing to, and which git exports itself under any `git -c …` |
/// | `GIT_DIR` / `GIT_WORK_TREE` / `GIT_INDEX_FILE` | **yes** — cleared, see `REPOSITORY_SELECTORS` below; this row read **no** until a review asked why a stop nothing declared was policy |
/// | `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` and their emails | **no** — they override the fixture's own `.git/config` identity |
/// | `.git/info/exclude` | **no** — inside the repository, so no config setting reaches it |
///
/// **The ignore row is closed through the row above it, by taking that channel rather than by blocking it.**
/// Neutralising the config *files* does not neutralise `core.excludesFile`, because
/// `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore` is the default excludes path git uses when **no** config file names one — so
/// emptying the files leaves the default in force. The setting has to be *named*, and the only channel that
/// carries a setting without a config file is `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`. **Occupying index `0` is what closes both
/// rows at once**: the setting reaches `git` from here, and the count this builder writes is what makes an
/// ambient key at any index unreachable. This paragraph said that channel *cannot be closed* until the row
/// above was measured; the channel is used, not open.
///
/// **Measured, on a fixture whose only exclusion came from an XDG ignore file:** `git add -A` with the three
/// file variables set and nothing else left the matching file *untracked* — a fixture silently built without
/// a file it named — and adds it once `core.excludesFile` is named. `git check-ignore` answers *ignored* and
/// stops. Both directions, and the first is why this moved into the builder rather than staying a flag each
/// judgement remembers: the reads were being fixed one at a time and every fixture construction was exposed.
///
/// **The `GIT_CONFIG_*` row is closed, and it read open until someone measured it.** The claim was that any
/// ambient key reaches `git`, `commit.gpgsign=true` included. It does not: [`Command::env`] overrides
/// `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` to `1`, `git` then reads index `0` only, and this builder owns index `0` — so an
/// ambient key at any index is unreachable and an ambient key at index `0` is overwritten.
///
/// **Which of the two closes it was measured afterwards, and it is the key rather than the count.** Deleting
/// `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` alone leaves the behavioural case green; deleting `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0` alone fails it.
/// Occupying index `0` is the guard; pinning the count is defence beside it. The same measurement says
/// `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` are redundant with each other — either alone carries the
/// system file, and only removing both fails a case. Recorded rather than tidied: redundancy that has been
/// measured is a different fact from redundancy nobody checked. Measured, with
/// `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=2` and `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_1=user.name` in the environment: under this builder
/// `git config --get user.name` exits `1` with no output, and the same pair without it answers the ambient
/// value. A row saying **no** where the answer is **yes** is not a conservative error — it reads as governed
/// policy and would send the next fixture author to build isolation they already have.
///
/// **`GIT_DIR` and its siblings were the row this table did not have, and then the row it got wrong.** They
/// are not an ignore channel; they move which repository `git` acts on, so they reach past `current_dir(dir)`
/// entirely. The row stood at **no** on the ground that nothing in this tree sets them — zero occurrences,
/// repository-wide — which is a corpus that cannot decide it: the channel is *ambient*, so the variable
/// arrives from outside the tree the sweep read, and a review named the same defect class this crate spends

/// appeared in neither observation register — and an undeclared stop is a defect rather than governed policy
/// by this repository's own reading rule. It is closed instead of declared, because closing it costs an
/// `env_remove` and refuses no caller.
///
/// A caller needing its own key starts at `_1` and sets `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` to `2`; overwriting the count

    // Nothing reads `%cd` today — the release spine reads `%ad` — so the committer date is set for symmetry
    // rather than for a consumer, and saying which it is keeps the next reader from looking for the one
    // that does not exist. It matters under `--amend`, which preserves the author date and rewrites the
    // committer date to the clock: a fixture routed around this builder would carry one of each.

    // so this reads as [`FIXTURE_DAY`] on every machine — where a local-midnight stamp would read as the day
    // before anywhere west of UTC.

    // could only be spelled as a literal — `concat!` takes literals and not a constant's name, measured with
    // rustc — and a second literal under a `concat!` reads as a derivation from the first while being a
