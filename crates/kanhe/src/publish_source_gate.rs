//! (`publish_source_integrity.rs`). Two constructions of "a signed release repository" is the twin-drift
//! class this repository keeps closing, so there is one, here, and both callers use it.
//!
//! It stands before an **irreversible act**: `cargo publish` records the commit it ran on in every tarball and
