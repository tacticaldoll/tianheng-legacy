/// **The drive-prefix arm is compiled and unexercised here — a gap in coverage, not a bound.** It reacts, and

/// missing is a run on a host this repository does not build for. It shares its answer with `RootDir`, which

/// directory named `C:` — cargo on that host does the same, so the two agree there too.
///
/// Negative runs. Removing the `CurDir` arm does not compile at all — the match over `Component` is
/// exhaustive, so an arm cannot be dropped in silence, which is a stronger guarantee than a direction can
/// give. Answering `CurDir` with `NamesNoDirectory` instead: `./crates/tianheng` classifies as
/// `NamesNoDirectory` where the row requires `crates/tianheng`. Folding `ParentDir` into `Absolute`: the
/// traversal rows come back `Absolute`, which is the wrong cause named — the defect this direction exists
