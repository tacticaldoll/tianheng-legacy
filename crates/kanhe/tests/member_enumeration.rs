//! Repository check: the two enumerations of this workspace's members agree.
//!
//! `cargo` names its members in `[workspace] members`; this repository's release gate reaches them by
//! walking `crates/*/Cargo.toml`. Both answer *which crates are the family*, and nothing has ever asked
//! whether they answer the same. They do, and this direction is what says so: the agreement is a premise
//! holding by layout rather than by declaration, and layout is not a thing anyone declared. The figure is
//! the run's, not this sentence's.
//!
//! **The direction that matters is the false negative.** A member declared outside `crates/` is invisible to
//! the walk: it would never be held to `version.workspace = true`, never enter the family the catalog's pins
//! are judged against, and never be read in the lock. Its stale pin would reach `cargo publish` through a
//! subject that never contained it — the same shape as a family crate offered without a `path`, one layer up,
//! in the **enumerator** rather than in the selector.
//!
//! The other direction is a false refusal and is asserted too: a directory under `crates/` carrying a
//! manifest that `[workspace] members` does not name is judged as a member cargo does not build.
//!
//! **Here rather than inside `judge`.** The gate's phases are a sequence whose order is observable, and its
//! failure matrix asserts which refusal a repository meets first; adding a `cargo metadata` call to that
//! sequence would move that order for every repository it judges. This asks the question of **this**
//! repository, which is the only one whose layout the premise is about.
