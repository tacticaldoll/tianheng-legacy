//! Collation: the test identifier a wrapper cites, against the tests its target registers.
//!
//! `libtest` exits `0` when `--exact` selects no test, so a rename disarms a wrapper silently and the script
//! proceeds to the act it stands in front of. The wrapper's own `1 passed` assertion covers that moment; this
//! covers the interval before it — a rename lands in a pull request long before anyone runs a wrapper.
