/// it did not run. Nothing reaches a merge either way. What this buys is that the local Definition of Done

/// **Which is why its remaining blind spots are not false negatives — for three of the five keys

/// Stating it once for all five would have rested a claim about the wrapper on the number of files in a
/// directory. [`a_missed_path_filter_costs_a_delay_only_while_one_workflow_exists`] holds that count instead,
/// so a second workflow re-opens the question where it is priced rather than after.
///
/// Seven review rounds found five positions in the reader below, two of them failing open — and against the

/// moves a job to `SKIPPED` is a key on the job itself, or a workflow-level path filter — so those are what
/// this reads.
///
/// **The names are held against [`JOBS`] both ways**, which is the form `AGENTS.md` prescribes for a claim

/// happened to sit, and a refusal there says *the gate did not run* about a closed pipe, immediately before
