//! `projection-register`'s check: the inventory of this repository's generated documents.
//!
//! Four documents are blessed and diffed by something, and until this existed the list of them was prose in
//! `AGENTS.md` — written across two paragraphs at four different times, checked by nothing. A fifth check
//! could project a document, hold it fresh, be named nowhere, and no gate or test would find out. That is the
//! class the two changes before this one closed a level down, carried by the mechanism whose whole purpose is to
//! stop documents drifting.
//!
//! What it owns is one obligation the projections' own capabilities do not: that the **set** of such documents is
//! known, that each has a check behind its warning, and that a reader can find each one. Freshness stays with
//! each holder — a second implementation of that rule, inside the register built to end duplication, would refute
//! itself.
