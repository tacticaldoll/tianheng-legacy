//! Repository check: the squash message a merge is about to record.
//!
//! It stands before a record. A merged squash on a release branch cannot be repaired: amending it changes its
//! hash, and the pull request's merge record cites that hash, so the two would name different things. The
//! subjects already carrying a serial when this gate was written stay as they are for exactly that reason.
//!
//! **The gate itself does not run in development.** There is no proposed message to judge until a merge is
//! being made, so `scripts/merge-pr.sh` supplies one and asks for the verdict at the one moment it can
//! answer. What runs in the ordinary suite is the failure matrix below, which holds the judgement to refusing
//! each shape — and to refusing it with its **own** message, so that no two sites can stand in for each
//! other.
