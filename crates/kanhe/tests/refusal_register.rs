//! Repository check: every registered refusal site is observed by a direction, and the unregistered ones
//! are counted.
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` states that **a guard is not a guard until it has been seen to fail**, and
//! `repository-checks` requires every refusal a check holds to have been run against a tree carrying the
//! shape it refuses. That requirement's scenarios held only its other clause — where a check may live — so
//! the half about refusals was carried by reviewer attention, and attention failed three times in one
//! window: a title guard with no negative run, three example-pin branches, then four internal-pin branches
//! in the change immediately after the one whose own record names the class.
//!
//! **Why nothing held it before.** A refusal's identity lived only in its message, and a message is a
//! *template* while a direction asserts a *rendering* of it. Five textual predicates were written against
//! that gap and measured; each was wrong in a different direction, and no reading of text answers the
//! question — which is what `pin_bites` already says about whether a test bites. So the site travels in the
//! value, a direction names the site it observed, and the two are compared by running.
//!
//! **The migration is visible rather than instantaneous.** Rewriting every site at once would be one
//! unreadable change; `refusal::violation` and `refusal::cannot_judge` stay beside their `_at` siblings
//! while modules move across, and the projection below carries how many sites have not moved. Registering a
//! site is a commitment that a direction observes it — a registered site no direction names refuses here —
//! so coverage cannot lag behind the migration.

// **Why a real parser closes this bug class rather than adding another shape to a scanner.** A
// hand-rolled predecessor of everything below needed a dedicated arm for every new shape it was
// found wrong on — a byte prefix before a char literal, a raw string's hash count, an escaped
// newline inside a string, a wrapped `use` list. Each fix was correct and each was local — none of
// them made the *next* shape less likely, because that reader was never parsing Rust; it was
// pattern-matching against Rust well enough for the corpus measured so far. `syn::parse_str` and
// `syn::Block::parse_within` parse the actual grammar, so a raw string, a byte char literal, or a
// closure whose parameter list spans two lines are read correctly by construction, not by an arm
// added for that specific shape after it was found wrong. See
// `a_naive_scanner_without_the_byte_prefix_fix_regresses_where_the_syn_reader_does_not` further
// down for "seen to fail" evidence of exactly that class, held against a reproduction of the

         rather than by reading a message.\n\n\
         **What this document does not claim.** `refusal::violation` and `refusal::cannot_judge` construct a \
         refusal carrying no site identity — `Site::OutsideRegister` — so this register does not see them. \
         Its corpus, `crates/kanhe/src`, holds **none** of them, which is the figure beside *carry no \
         identity at all* above. The test targets do hold them, and this corpus excludes those: none is \
         registered, held, or declared here, and whether any should have taken an identity is a judgement \
         this document does not make. **No count of them is given**, and two different things stand in \
         the way. One is a floor: a name taken by reference reads the same whether it is the constructor or a \
         local that shares its spelling, and no reader of text can decide which. The other is a debt: whether \
         an occurrence is inside a closure's parameter list is a **position**, and this reader answers it by \
         counting the pipes standing before the name on its line — which is right for every shape the corpus \
         holds and is an approximation of the position rather than the position itself. The first cannot be \
         closed; the second can.\n\n\
         A site that no direction holds is **declared unheld**, with why, an owner and a tracker, in the \
         table this register reads. There is no third state among *registered* sites: one is held or \
         declared, and the register refuses anything else.\n\nGenerated from `crates/kanhe/src/**.rs` by \
