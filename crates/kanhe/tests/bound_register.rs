//! Repository check: the observation bound register.
//!
//! Every observation bound this family declares lives as a scenario in `openspec/specs/*/spec.md` whose
//! heading marks it one. This check holds each of them to carrying exactly one citation — a `PINNED-BY`
//! naming a test the harness registers, or an `UNPINNED` naming a tracker the repository tracks — resolves
//! every reference, refuses a bound stated in prose and declared nowhere, and generates
//! `docs/observation-bounds.md` from what it read.
//!
//! **Whether a cited name is a test that runs is decided by the test harness, not by the source text.**
//! `observation-bound-register` makes that normative, and it is the discipline this repository adopted after
//! measuring and rejecting the text route three times: a `pinned by` line could otherwise be satisfied by a
//! definition commented out, inside a string literal, removed by a `cfg`, or trapped in an uninvoked macro.
//! So this check runs `cargo test -p <member> -- --list` per package — per package rather than per
//! workspace, because the enumeration carries no crate label while a citation may be crate-qualified, and
//! this repository already has one test name registered in two crates.
//!
//! Running cargo from inside a test cargo launched was measured rather than assumed: the outer build lock is
//! released before the test binary runs, so the inner enumeration neither blocks nor rebuilds, and it shares
//! the warm target directory instead of paying for one of its own.

fn preamble(unpinned: usize, total: usize) -> String {
    format!(
        r#"# Observation bounds

Every **observation bound** this family declares: a claim that a reaction deliberately stops at a
named shape, so that shape is governed policy rather than a defect.

**{unpinned} of {total} declared bounds have no pinning test.** That figure is the register's
audit backlog and leads the document because a number in a footnote is not read. Each such bound names
the tracker that owns closing it.

Generated from `openspec/specs/*/spec.md` by `crates/kanhe/tests/bound_register.rs`. **{DO_NOT_EDIT}** —
regenerate with `BLESS=1 {MARKER}=1 cargo test -p kanhe --test bound_register`. A stale projection fails that gate.

**What this document does not claim.** It lists the bounds the specs *state in a recognizable form*: a
scenario whose heading marks it a bound. The undeclared-prose direction that keeps this list honest has known
residuals and a deliberate exemption, each stated in this document rather than left in the check's
comments, because a residual a reader cannot see is one the register is lying about:

1. **Unrecognized wording.** A bound worded outside the scanned form — "out-of-scope", "does not claim
   to observe", "a stated, inherited bound" — is invisible to the scan.
2. **The scan is line-oriented.** A statement whose bound names continue onto the next line is examined
   only on the line carrying the trigger words.
3. **A reference clears more than it names.** `(bound: …)` clears the prose it sits with regardless of
   how many bounds that prose states, or whether the bound it names is one of them. This is how a
   retired `#[path]` bound survived two sweeps inside a sentence listing four inherited bounds behind
   one reference to a fifth. The discipline is one reference per stated bound, and it is the author's:
   closing it would mean reading which bounds a sentence lists, which no repository check can do. Scanning
   paragraphs instead of lines was measured against that defect and would not have caught it, because
   the paragraph carries the same clearing reference.

The **exemption**: prose under a requirement whose heading names bounds is not reported, because several
such requirements state their bounds as a numbered list, and requiring each item to become its own
scenario would restructure them and read worse. Its price
is charged — such a requirement must declare at least one bound scenario — but the other items of its
list are unregistered, which is why this list is a floor rather than a proof of completeness.

The second floor is the same shape. A bound declared twice is caught only when both declarations cite
the **same pinning test**, which is a fact rather than a heuristic; two declarations of one behaviour
citing two different tests are invisible. Telling those apart from two genuine bounds over sibling
shapes is a semantic judgment — two operand dimensions here declare identically-worded bounds over
`dyn` and `impl Trait`, each defended by its own test, and each must declare its own — so nothing
observes it and no bound of the register capability claims it.

A third floor was stated here for one change and is **retired**: a `pinned by` line could be satisfied
by a definition that never ran — commented out, inside a string, removed by a `cfg`, or trapped in an
uninvoked macro — because the scan read only the form of a line. Test-ness is now decided by the test
harness enumeration, which registers none of those. The weakness survives only in the source-text
fallback used where no manifest exists, which the register spec describes.
