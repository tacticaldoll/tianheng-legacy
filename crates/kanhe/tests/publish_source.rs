//! Repository check: the source a `cargo publish` runs from.
//!
//! It stands before an **irreversible act**. `cargo publish` records the commit it ran on in every tarball's
//! `.cargo_vcs_info.json`, and a version can never be re-uploaded — the `0.4.0` family recorded a release
//! branch's tip rather than the commit its tag names, permanently, which is why this exists.
//!
//! **The gate itself does not run in development.** No development checkout is a release snapshot, so a
//! pre-flight run could only ever refuse; `scripts/publish.sh` sets `TIANHENG_PUBLISH_SOURCE=1` immediately
//! before publishing and this judges the repository then. What runs in the ordinary suite is the failure
//! matrix below, which builds repositories in known-wrong shapes and holds the judgement to refusing each —
//! and to refusing them as a **violation** rather than as a cannot-judge, because an operator standing before
//! an irreversible act must be able to tell "the source disagrees" from "the source could not be read".
