//! Collation: authored text against the law it describes.
//!
//! The membership of a declared allowlist belongs to `shengmo::law` and its projection. A second copy in a
//! comment or a document is a source of truth that goes stale with no check to say so, and the repair is
//! always the same — point at `AGENTS.self-law.md` instead of restating what it renders.
//!
//! This check read **one** crate's line comments against **one** dimension's allowlist until this change.
//! Measured, `PROJECT.md` named `serde_json`, `xuanji` and `xingbiao` — every member of 圭表's live
//! allowlist — in a file class nothing scanned. A rule enforced at one site and not its neighbour is a rule
//! about the site.
//!
//! Generated documents are excluded, and not as a convenience: a projection names every member of every
//! allowlist because rendering them is its job.
