//! Repository check: a branch a guard has already made unreachable is not written.
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` states the bound — *fail loud only on observable misconfiguration, no defensive
//! over-foolproofing of impossible states* — and until now nothing observed it. `str::split` and
//! `str::rsplit` always yield at least one item, so a `.next()` on either is always `Some`, and every
//! consumer that treats it as fallible is a branch nothing can reach: the fallback is dead, and reading it
//! tells a later reader that the empty case happens.
//!
//! **This was measured once and not swept.** `merge_message_gate` records the measurement in its own words —
//! *`"".split(". ").next()` is `Some("")`, measured — so the branch saying the clause has no sentence after
//! its anchor was unreachable* — and replaced its own site. Measured when this reader was written: twenty-four
//! sibling sites across three crates kept the shape, two of them written *after* that paragraph existed. A
//! measurement that repairs one site and leaves its class open is the shape this repository removes on sight;
//! a reaction is what closes it.
//!
//! **What it closes is the DECIDABLE part of the class, and saying otherwise was an over-claim.** The
//! consumer side here is general — chosen by what each does to the `Option` rather than by the spellings one
//! round met — but the producer side is two, and deliberately: `str::split` and `str::rsplit` always yield an
//! item *unconditionally*, which is what a reader over text can know. `xs.max()`, `slice.chars().next_back()`
//! and `entry.file_name()` are always-`Some` only on a producer that is non-empty, and whether it is takes
//! the surrounding code rather than the line — measured, the tree carries such calls where a lexical reader
//! cannot tell which. Widening the list would refuse them, and refusing a live site is a defect of its own —
//! while the Core Contract's *one forbidden bug* is the other direction, a real violation that silently
//! passes, which is why the list closes the decidable part rather than guessing at the rest.
//!
//! So the wider class — *any* branch a guard has already made unreachable — is a row in `AGENTS.md`'s
//! disposition table, applied by a reviewer, beside the other rows no reaction can reach. A review found four
//! live sites of it in one pass, which is the row working.
//!
//! `splitn` and `rsplitn` are outside the corpus: `"".splitn(0, ' ').next()` is `None`, so their fallbacks are
//! reachable. `.expect(…)` is admitted — it documents the impossibility instead of branching on it — and so
//! is `.filter(…)`, which can genuinely produce `None`.
//!
//! The corpus is executed Rust through [`kanhe::region::Source::rust`], so this file's own prose may write
//! the shape it forbids: a comment is not code, and a reader matching the bare text would refuse its own
//! reason.
