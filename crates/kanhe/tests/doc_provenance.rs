//! Repository check: a doc comment in a published crate does not index its own provenance by review round.
//!
//! `AGENTS.md`'s *What earns a place in a doc comment* table settles the disposition: **a review round
//! number, a pull request number → provenance**, while *a past defect described with the invariant it
//! violated* keeps the invariant and drops the debrief. Twenty-eight doc lines across five published crates
//! carried the round number anyway, eleven of them as the index to `see PROJECT.md's Decisions` — and
//! `PROJECT.md` holds **no** entry organised by round, so those eleven pointed at a structure that does not
//! exist. Measured in the 0.5.0 window, before the cleanup this check now holds.
//!
//! **Not an adopter-facing defect, and saying so is the honest scope.** None of the twenty-eight attached to
//! a `pub` item — ten private, eight `pub(crate)`, one private-module `//!` — so `cargo doc --no-deps`
//! generates none of them and docs.rs shows none. The reader is whoever opens the source, which includes an
//! agent with it in context, and that is reason enough: the round number names *when*, not *what*, and
//! nothing downstream reads it.
//!
//! **The corpus stops at doc comments, deliberately, and the stop is observed rather than claimed.** A `//`
//! inner comment is a note to whoever edits the line, not part of any item's contract, and twenty-seven of
//! them carry a round number today. `BACKLOG.md` carries that residue. The precision direction below gives
//! this reader both forms and requires it to separate them, so the boundary is a property of a run.
