//! Repository check: a token with a constant owner is not spelled again as a literal inside its reach.
//!
//! Two constants exist because one token had to have one owner — `kanhe::region::DO_NOT_EDIT`, the marker a
//! generated document declares itself with, and `shengmo::workspace::MARKER`, the variable saying a run must
//! find a repository. Both were then written out again as literals in every module that could reach them,
//! which is the shape `verdict_channel` closed between a shell script and Rust and which had stayed open
//! between Rust and Rust.
//!
//! **The corpus is what can reach the constant, and nothing wider.** `MARKER` is spelled out in `tianheng`,
//! `louke` and `xuanji` — published crates that cannot depend on `shengmo`, because `shengmo` depends on
//! `tianheng` and the edge would close a cycle — and `DO_NOT_EDIT` in `shengmo`'s own law projection header,
//! which cannot reach `kanhe`. Those are facts about the dependency graph rather than sites anyone declined
//! to fix, so they sit outside this check's subject rather than inside it as exceptions. No count is given:
//! nothing enumerates that set, so a figure here would be a census with no producer.
