//! Collation: what a capability says it governs, against what a change actually touched.

//! Which capability a requirement belongs to is decided once, in a proposal, and was checked by nothing. It
//! went wrong twice in one window — a requirement about `scripts/publish.sh` filed under a capability whose
//! subject is repository checks, and a member filled by the one criterion that says where a check must *not*
//! live — and a reader caught both.
//!
//! The touched set is **produced**: the change's diff against its base. Reading it from the change's own
