//! Repository check: every in-repo fixture and example manifest declares its own workspace root.
//!
//! **This holds a single line of defence, not a second one.** The root `Cargo.toml`'s `exclude` key is a real
//! second line for `examples/`, and cargo offers none at all for the fixtures: measured, a package nested
//! inside a workspace member's own directory cannot be excluded, whichever form the entry takes — exact path,
//! directory prefix, or glob. Entries naming `crates/*/tests/fixtures` were therefore inert while reading as
//! protection, and were dropped in favour of this check.
//!
//! What a missing `[workspace]` costs: the fixture is inferred into this workspace, so its deliberate faults —
//! the violations these fixtures exist to carry — become this workspace's own, and `cargo build --workspace`
//! starts compiling code written to be wrong. For a fixture under a member, nothing else notices.
