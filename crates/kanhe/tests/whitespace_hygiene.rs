//! Repository check: whitespace hygiene across every tracked text file.
//!
//! No tracked text file carries trailing whitespace on a line, ends with a blank line, or is missing its
//! final newline.
//!
//! **This was the last judgement in this crate still answering with a bare `assert!`.** Every sibling returns
//! [`Refusal`], which separates *the source disagrees* from *the source could not be read* — and this one
//! collapsed the two in the direction that reports clean: a tracked file it could not open was `continue`d,
//! so a file nobody could read counted as hygienic. `census::sweep` refuses the identical condition, in its
//! own words, because *an unread document is not a document without one*, and `reference_integrity` states it
//! as a rule: a file this check claims to have inspected must have been read.
