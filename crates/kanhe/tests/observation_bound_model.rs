//! `observation-bound-model`'s check: the specs' declared bounds and the code's typed declarations are one
//! set, and the classification is projected where a reader can count it.
//!
//! Why this lives in Kanhe rather than in a dimension: this unpublished repository-governance crate sees
//! 圭表, 渾儀 and 漏刻 through Tianheng, and the bijection is meaningless from inside one of them. Why it is a Rust check rather
//! than a seventh shell gate: a `PINNED-BY` citation resolves only to a harness-registered Rust function, so a
//! shell-defended capability could not pin the bounds this one declares — they would land `UNPINNED` and
//! increase the register projection's audit backlog.
//!
//! What it does **not** take over: `crates/kanhe/tests/bound_register.rs` still owns the citation, tracker, prose and
//! projection directions. This check owns one obligation — that every declared bound is classified, and every
//! classification names a declared bound.
