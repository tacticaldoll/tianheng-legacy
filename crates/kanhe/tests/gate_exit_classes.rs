//! Repository check: a wrapper's exit class agrees with the gate it fronts.
//!
//! Two facts live in two languages here. `refusal::Kind` types the distinction a gate draws — a source that
//! **disagrees** against one that **could not be read** — and a shell wrapper turns a gate's failure into a
//! process exit class. The wrappers read the class out of the gate's own output, which means a Rust enum's
//! rendering and a `grep` pattern in a script must agree. Two places that must agree is the shape this
//! repository has spent a window replacing, so it is checked rather than commented.
//!
//! **What went wrong without it.** Five could-not-read conditions in `scripts/merge-pr.sh` were split across
//! both exit classes with no stated rule, and two of the facts on the `1` side are ones
//! `merge_message_gate::judge` types as cannot-judge — so the wrapper reported as a disagreement what its own
//! gate calls unjudgeable. No direction could have caught it: the ones covering those sites asserted only that
//! the wrapper failed, which cannot see `1` from `2`.
