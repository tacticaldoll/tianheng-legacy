/// maintainer's machine and not in CI.

/// Demonstrated rather than asserted in prose: the fixture is signed by an ephemeral key named in no
/// allowed-signers file anywhere, and every git invocation building it runs with `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` and
/// `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` at `/dev/null`, so no ambient configuration can name it either. The gate accepts it.

/// A previous form of this pin built such a fixture and then ran a placeholder test against **this**
/// repository, ignoring the fixture entirely. It passed for a reason that had nothing to do with the bound.
