//! Repository check: every in-repository path named by tracked prose must exist.
//!
//! This class was hand-swept twice — once for `.md` only — and a module split landing after that sweep
//! reintroduced it in nine places. A reader who greps for a named path and finds nothing cannot tell stale
//! prose from a bad checkout.
//!
//! **Which formats carry prose is declared once, and every tracked format must be classified.** Before that it
//! was two lists: an extension filter deciding what to open, and a marker rule deciding which of its lines to
//! read. A format could sit in one and not the other, which is how shell — the two sanctioned wrappers, whose
//! comments cite the Rust gates they sequence *by path* — went unread while the marker rule had known `#` all
//! along. Closing that by adding one extension would have been the third turn of the same handle: the same
//! window replaced two argument denylists with allowlists for exactly this reason, and an extension list beside
//! a marker rule is the shape where a format is admitted with no marker or given a marker and never opened.
//!
//! So [`FORMATS`] is the single declaration, and [`every_tracked_format_is_classified`] fails on a format the
//! repository holds and it does not name. A new file type arrives as one row, or as a failure — not as a
//! silence. Measured when this landed: shell and YAML were the formats it had been reading nothing from, and
//! neither named an absent path, so both were silences rather than backlogs.
//!
//! It judges **tracked content**, never the worktree. A path present on disk and in no commit satisfies a
//! reference for the author who created it and nobody else, which is the direction this repository's gates are
//! held to generally.

// --- a reference nothing can check ------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The rest of this file asks whether a named path exists. This asks whether a reference was written in a form
// anything could ask that about.
//
// There is a ladder, and this repository has been down it. An intra-doc link is checked by the compiler; a
// path is checked by the sweep above; a path with a line number is checked by nothing; and a reference naming
// only a position is not even a name. Measured here: one such reference was off by 86 lines and another by 98,
// and the second was written by someone who had just been corrected about the first — which is the criterion
// `scripts/publish.sh` states for itself, that a rule stated and then missed needs a check rather than another
// sentence.
//
// **Every shape this refuses, and every reading it must leave alone, is a string in
// `every_positional_shape_reacts_and_a_named_thing_does_not`.** Named there and not described here, because
// this comment is inside the corpus: prose about the rule, written in the shapes the rule refuses, is the
// self-reading trap this repository has met before. The specimens live where they can be executed.
//
// **Comment lines only, through the same `is_inspected_line` rule as the sibling sweep.** That is a position,
// not a marker: a specimen written as a string literal is on an executed line and cannot be mistaken for a
// reference, and nothing can hide a comment inside one. It also settles the corpus question the same way for
// both properties in this file.
//
// **Every line-comment format, derived from [`FORMATS`] rather than listed again.** This filtered `.rs` and
// `.sh` by extension — a second list beside the declaration, which is the defect the declaration was introduced
// one change earlier to end. It left `.toml`, `.yml`, `Cargo.lock`, `CODEOWNERS` and `.gitignore` unswept, each
// of them source where a positional phrase rots exactly as it does in Rust, and nothing about the Markdown
// reasoning below reached any of them. Deriving the scope means a format admitted to the corpus is swept for
// both properties or for neither.
//
// Markdown stays out, and now by CONSTRUCTION rather than by omission: it is the one format classified as
// `Prose::Whole`, so it cannot be a line-comment format. In a record — a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, a `BACKLOG.md`
// history — a positional phrase legitimately narrates a past state, and telling that from a live reference is a
// judgement over prose, the instrument this repository designed, measured three times and rejected. In source
// there is no such reading: a comment describes the file it is in, so the reference is either live and rotting
// or narration that could have named the construct instead. Rephrasing costs a word.
