//! Repository check: no comment paragraph in this repository's Rust is written twice in a row.
//!
//! A paste that lands twice compiles, formats, lints and reads as deliberate. Nothing in the toolchain has an
//! opinion about it, and the second copy is invisible to the person who made it for the same reason it was
//! made: the eye that skips a paragraph it has already read is the eye that pasted it.
//!
//! It matters here more than the missing newline this crate's sibling refuses, because of what this
//! repository's prose is **for**. The rules are carried by weight rather than by enforcement — what sits in
//! an agent's context is what gets imitated — and a paragraph appearing twice is that weight doubled by
//! accident. The defect this was written for stood in `release_coherence_gate`, where the paragraph naming
//! why presence is asked by `ls-tree` rather than `show` was six lines long and stood twice, byte-identical.
//!
//! **What is compared is line content, not line bytes**, so a block terminated `\r\n` and a copy terminated
//! `\n` are one repetition here. A paste an editor re-terminated is still a paste, and requiring the
//! terminators to agree would let it through — a silent false negative, which is the one direction the Core
//! Contract forbids. The requirement says so in those words rather than saying *byte-identical*, which
//! claimed a precision this reader deliberately does not have.
//!
//! **A comment-shaped line inside a string literal is text, not a comment.** This repository holds Rust
//! fixtures as Rust strings, so the two cannot be told apart by reading a trimmed line — and the class is
//! not hypothetical: the first spelling of this check's own fixture was such a string, and the sweep
//! reported this file. Comments are what a lexer discards, so the classification is taken from
//! `proc_macro2`: a line strictly inside a literal's span is that literal's text. A doc comment reaches the
//! lexer as `#[doc = "…"]`, so it is told apart by the one thing that distinguishes it — a literal whose own
//! first line is comment-shaped is a doc comment — and shadowing those would have stopped this check reading
//! `///` at all, which is a false negative over most of this repository's prose.
//!
//! **The reach is adjacency, and the corpus is Rust.** Both are stops this reader makes deliberately, so
//! both are declared rather than left to be inferred: `docs/observation-bounds.md` carries them as
//! `repository-checks/a-paragraph-repeated-out-of-line-is-not-read-a-stated-bound` and
//! `repository-checks/a-paragraph-repeated-in-prose-is-not-read-a-stated-bound`.
