//! Shared scan hearts for the existential-exposure boundaries (dyn-trait, impl-trait,

//! the module's items, walk each with a per-item collector, then render, sort, and dedup — differing
//! only in the collector (and, for the operand-scoped path, an added principal-resolution filter).
//! These two helpers hold that skeleton once so the three boundary modules pass only their
//! collector, rather than each re-implementing the identical pipeline.
