/// The key is the bounded thing's own name — a parameter's identifier, or a where-predicate's
/// rendered bounded type — never the position's index, because `semantic-signature-coupling` forbids
/// identity resting on scan order or item ordinal. A bounded type that cannot be rendered falls back
/// to an internal positional sentinel built from the enclosing item's `ordinal` and the predicate's
/// own index, which is never published: it exists only to keep two unrenderable bounds in one block
/// from sharing a key, and the shared `reject_positional_identity` gate turns it into a loud refusal.
///
/// Completeness rests on a language rule, verified against a real `rustc` rather than assumed: an
/// `impl` block's generic parameters cannot carry defaults ("defaults for generic parameters are not
/// allowed here"), so a parameter contributes only its bounds — or, for a const parameter, its type
/// annotation. Lifetime parameters and lifetime where-predicates name no type, so they contribute
/// nothing. That is why walking positions loses nothing against walking the whole `Generics` node,
/// which is what a caller keying by position replaces.
