/// and there is nothing in the emitted text to grep for the one they have.

/// **Two arms, and a third was declared and could not be reached.** It named a path resolving to no
/// candidate at all, which no producer can construct: `resolve_path_all` with `BareFallback::CurrentModule`
/// always yields at least one candidate — a crate-relative path yields one, a `UseMap` entry holds at least
/// one because it is pushed onto after `or_default`, and the bare fallback yields exactly one. Measured:
