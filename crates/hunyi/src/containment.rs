/// `semantic-forbidden-marker`'s "Anchor resolution and observation bounds" requirement (the
/// blanket-impl/projection/qualified-path shadow scenarios) for the full rationale. Without the
/// shadow, a blanket `impl<T> Marker for T {}` beside an unrelated `use
/// crate::domain::Innocent as T;` fabricated a marker-acquisition finding on `Innocent`, which the
/// source never actually impls the marker for.
///
/// The canonicalization is folded in **here** so a self-type is canonical *by construction*: a
/// caller cannot resolve a self-type and forget to close the re-export/alias hop (the sibling
/// capabilities' shared-canonicalizer discipline, made structural at the one self-type resolver).
/// Routed through the crate's own [`expand_canonical_paths`] rather than a second hand-rolled
/// fixpoint, so this resolver shares that function's hop cap (bounding a divergent, non-cycling
/// rewrite chain that an exact-repeat guard alone cannot catch — a gap a hand-rolled loop here once
/// had) and its longest-prefix alias rewrite (so a member reached *through* an aliased prefix, not
/// just an exact alias key, still lands — closing a second, narrower false negative the same swap
/// fixed). `alias_targets` carries the `CurrentModule`-fallback landing, so an alias to a bare local
/// struct (`type Bar = Real`) is caught — which the `Ignore`-built exposure alias map deliberately
/// does not, the reason this is not the exposure canonicalizer. A defining path is never a key in
/// either map (an alias/re-export name cannot clash with a definition in its module), so the
/// fixpoint never over-follows past a definition.
///
/// Returns **every** landing candidate, cfg-blind like the exposure pipeline's own
/// `expand_canonical_paths`: a self type whose head, or whose `type X = Y;` alias target, is a
/// mutually-exclusive `#[cfg]`-gated `use` name must not have its other candidate silently
/// dropped (found on adversarial review of `hunyi-cfg-branch-use-reexport-merging`: the
