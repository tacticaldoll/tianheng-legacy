//! The inbound value-namespace reaction reacts to a **value binding** and to nothing else.
//!
//! `resolve_import_module` reads only the path, so `use m::foo;` where `m` declares both `mod foo` and
//! `fn foo` resolves to the descendant `m::foo` and would miss that the import also reaches `m`.
//! That closure consults the value namespace, and these are the shapes it must NOT mistake for one.
