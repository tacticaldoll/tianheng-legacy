//! Dogfood gate: every boundary family the composed shell publishes has an adopter-shaped owner.
//!
//! **Both sides are derived, and that is the whole design.** The requirement this holds once asked for "an
//! executable, reviewable inventory" mapping a published family set to its owners, and named the set in
//! prose — thirteen families, anchored to the `0.2.x` surface. A hand-kept list beside an enumerator is the
//! shape this repository keeps removing: a family added to the code keeps its old answer in the list, and
//! nobody re-examines it. So neither side is written down here.
//!
//! - The **families** are the boundary types `crates/tianheng/src/lib.rs` re-exports. That is one uniform
//!   source and it is the right one: the composed shell's public surface is exactly what an adopter can
//!   declare, and a standalone adopter reaches the same types through the dimension crates.
//! - The **owners** are the tracked files under `examples/` and this crate that name such a type — an
//!   isolated example workspace, or the repository's own self-law.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not a family
//!
//! `sans_io_pure` and `no_existential_leak` were listed beside the families and are **profiles**, not
//! families: `Constitution::sans_io_pure`'s own documentation says it is "a convenience over declaring the
//! two boundaries by hand; it adds no new reaction". A profile is a bundle, so covering the boundaries it
//! bundles covers it by construction, and counting it as a thirteenth family would have this gate assert
//! coverage of a reaction that does not exist.
//!
//! # What this does not claim
//!
//! That an owner exercises its family *well*. It asserts that a family is reachable from something an
//! adopter can read and run, which is what makes a family lose its owner visible. Whether the owner's
//! assertion is a good one is the owner's own test's job.
//!
//! # The residual: ownership is credited by type NAME, so a profile is invisible
//!
//! A profile constructs its boundaries internally — `Constitution::sans_io_pure` builds a
//! `ModuleBoundary` and an `AsyncExposureBoundary` from one `SansIoPure` — and a file declaring the family
//! that way never spells the type. This reader would not credit it.
//!
//! Live instance, and the reason this is stated rather than reasoned about: `examples/sans-io-pure` declares
//! async exposure in its `src/governance.rs` **through the profile**, and is credited here only because its
//! `tests/reaction.rs` happens to name `AsyncExposureBoundary` outright. Delete that one test line and the
//! family reads as unowned while the example still teaches it — a false refusal, in the direction this
//! reaction exists to make loud.
//!
//! Not closed by expanding the reader, because the honest closure is not a bigger name list: it is asking
//! what a profile *expands to*, which means evaluating constructor bodies rather than reading declarations.
//! Filed in `BACKLOG.md` as WATCH with the trigger that would change the answer.
