//! Dogfood gate: every example's product reaction behaves as its documentation declares.
//!
//! An example is a claim about what an adopter gets, and the claim is the **exit code**: a demo that reacts
//! exits 1, a run-mode that only reports events exits 0. Checking that an example merely builds says nothing
//! about either — the reaction it demonstrates could be gone entirely.
//!
//! Every example is built against **local source**, and that the patch took effect is asserted rather than
//! assumed: a `patch.crates-io` that silently fails to apply leaves the example exercising the *published*
//! crates, so the suite would pass while demonstrating nothing about this working tree. That direction is the
//! whole reason the patch is checked instead of trusted.
//!
//! It is gated behind `TIANHENG_EXAMPLES` and named on its own line in the Definition of Done and in CI,
//! because it builds seven separate crate graphs.
