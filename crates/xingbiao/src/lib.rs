//! 星表 (xīngbiǎo) — the single reader of truth for **what the workspace tree IS**.
//!
//! Reads `cargo metadata --no-deps` and looks up packages and their crate-root source files:
//! the tabulated catalog every observation dimension references before it observes. Spawns
//! `cargo` and parses its JSON (`serde_json` + std only, no `syn`).
//!
//! **The criterion, because this charter has widened twice and an enumeration of what it holds goes
//! stale.** A fact belongs here when every dimension must agree on it *before* observing, and it is a
//! fact about the tree rather than a reading of what the tree contains. Which packages exist and where
//! their roots are; whether two paths are one file; whether a path is there at all, and whether being
//! unable to tell is the same answer as its absence. Each of those is asked by 圭表, 渾儀 and 漏刻
//! alike, and a dimension answering it privately is how three readers came to disagree about one tree.
//!
//! **What the criterion refuses** is as load-bearing as what it admits: an interpretation of source is a
//! dimension's own observation, not a fact about the tree. `cargo metadata` says which file is a crate
//! root; what the tokens in that file mean is 圭表's or 渾儀's answer and belongs to whichever is
//! asking. The line is between *what is there* and *what it says*.
//!
//! The widenings are named rather than left to be inferred: the path-identity primitives
//! ([`canonicalize_or_fail`], [`try_visit`]) arrived for a module-graph cycle guard, and the
//! filesystem-answer policy ([`is_regular_file`], [`is_directory`] and the crate-private criterion behind
//! them) arrived after all three dimensions were measured collapsing *absent* into *unreadable* — each is
//! one notch finer than the last, on the same
//! question of what the tree holds.
//!
//! Sits beneath all three observation dimensions — static (圭表), semantic (渾儀) and runtime (漏刻,
//! through its CI-only `audit` face) — preventing twin-drift in what they take the tree to be.

/// inside directory `a` onto one label, destroying the injectivity this exists for; on Windows both
/// `\` and `/` separate, so replacing one is incomplete. `components()` is the only thing that knows
/// which is which per platform. A component cannot contain `/` anywhere, so `/` in a label
/// unambiguously means a component boundary.
///
/// Canonical path separators ensure cross-platform baseline stability: without this, paths would
/// produce `src/lib.rs` on Linux and `src\lib.rs` on Windows, causing a baseline recorded on one
/// platform to match nothing on the other.
///
/// **Bytes.** Every byte that is not part of a valid UTF-8 sequence is percent-escaped, and a literal
/// `%` becomes `%25` so no escaped label can be spelled by an unescaped one. `Path::display()` is
/// **lossy** — it replaces each undecodable byte with U+FFFD — so two paths differing only in such
/// bytes would produce one label, one identity, and a baseline accepting the first would silently
/// suppress the second's never-accepted violation. This half is load-bearing for 漏刻, whose labels come
/// from filesystem walks where such a name is reachable; for 圭表/渾儀 it cannot trigger, since their
/// paths are built from `cargo metadata`'s JSON strings and Cargo refuses to operate under a non-UTF-8
/// path at all (`error: path contains invalid UTF-8 characters`). Holding one rule for both is what
/// keeps the dimension where it cannot trigger from drifting away from the one where it can.
///
/// `as_encoded_bytes`'s encoding is unspecified but self-consistent within a platform, which is all this
/// needs: a label is never decoded back, only compared with another label produced the same way. On
/// Windows that encoding is WTF-8, so an unpaired surrogate's bytes escape exactly as an invalid unix
/// byte does.
///
/// **Stated normalizations.** `Component::CurDir` contributes nothing and repeated separators collapse,
/// so `./a` and `a//b` label as `a` and `a/b`. Both name the same file, and neither form is reachable
/// from the inputs these labels are built from — a `cargo metadata` `src_path` or a walked path, both

/// **Fixture infrastructure, deliberately withheld from the API contract.** It is `pub` because test targets
/// in other crates need it across crate boundaries, and `#[doc(hidden)]` because 星表's domain is
/// declared workspace data — a scratch-directory claim is not in it. It lives here for a dependency-graph
/// reason (the lightest crate already reachable from every dimension), and a dependency-graph reason is not
/// a domain fit.
///
/// The distinction is not cosmetic at `0.5.0`, which is the release that first publishes it: a documented
/// item is a promise an adopter may build on and this family cannot then withdraw, while a hidden one keeps
/// every present caller compiling and commits to nothing. Zero call sites outside a test target or a
/// `#[cfg(test)]` module were measured before hiding it.
///
/// **`create_dir_all` accepts a pre-existing symlink to a directory.** Measured: `create_dir_all` on such a
/// link returns `Ok(())` and every subsequent write lands in the link's *target*, while `create_dir` cannot
/// follow a symlink and returns `AlreadyExists` — the narrow call is what makes the refusal possible at all.
///
/// A fixture scratch root is typically built from `temp_dir()` and a predictable name (a process id, a
/// counter), so it is guessable by anyone on the machine. The ordinary `remove_dir_all` then `create_dir_all`
/// idiom leaves a window between the two calls in which a planted symlink is silently adopted, and everything
/// the fixture writes afterward lands wherever that link points. `create_dir` closes the window rather than
/// narrowing it: the root is claimed only if this call is the one that created it, and `remove_dir_all`
/// itself removes a symlink at the path rather than following it, so an attacker must win a race rather than
/// leave something lying around in advance.
///
/// **This is about the root only.** Every directory beneath a root this call already claimed is safe to build
/// with the ordinary `create_dir_all`, because nothing outside the fixture's own control could have planted
/// anything there first.
