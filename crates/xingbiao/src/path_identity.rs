//! Shared path-identity primitives for a cycle/dedup guard: every observation dimension that
//! walks a module graph or a `#[path]` remap needs to know "is this file the same file I have
//! already opened", and the answer must be the resolved (symlink-following) identity, never the
//! literal path string — two literal paths can name one real file. Centralized here so 圭表 and
//! 渾儀's cycle guards share one canonicalize-failure policy rather than drifting across call sites.

/// silent skip — so an unresolvable path surfaces as a scan error instead of quietly admitting a

/// wants a different failure posture composes its own handling around this, but must not
/// reimplement the canonicalize call itself).
