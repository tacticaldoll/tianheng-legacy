# semantic-reexport-exposure Specification

## Purpose
Close a false negative in signature-coupling: a named public re-export
(`pub use crate::infra::X;`) republishes a forbidden type on a module's public surface, so a bare
`must_not_expose` must react to it by default — like any other public-API exposure. Covers
aliased, grouped, whole-module (`{self}`), and facade-chained re-exports, and a glob whose root
resolves in/under the forbidden set. It also covers re-exports rooted at an **external crate**
(v0.1.4) — determined by the crate's external-crate name set (declared dependencies, `.rename`-aware
and `-`→`_` normalized, ∪ the sysroot crates), including single-segment crate-root re-exports and a
local facade chain terminating at an extern type. Default-on and API-compatible (the DSL is
unchanged), so it ships on the patch line as a behavior-changing bugfix; the residual — a
non-forbidden-root glob, a re-export routed through a *foreign* module (needs the foreign AST), a
**module-scoped** source `extern crate … as` rename (the **crate-root** form reacts, including
through a type alias or a facade closure) or a distinct `[lib] name` (absent from `cargo metadata
--no-deps`), a facade hop re-exporting a privately-`use`d bare name, an edition-2015 relative local
re-export, macro-generated — is a stated bound (bound: semantic-reexport-exposure/a-facade-hop-re-exporting-a-privately-used-bare-name-is-a-stated-bound), never a silent pass. (`pub extern crate` is now an
observed exposure, not a bound.)

## Subject

- `crates/hunyi/src/tests/*.rs`

## Requirements
### Requirement: Named public re-exports are observed by default

A bare `must_not_expose(forbidden)` boundary SHALL observe the governed module's **named public
re-exports** (`pub use`) and react to a forbidden type republished through them. This is **on by
default** (no opt-in): a public re-export is the most direct public-API exposure — a missed
public-surface item, not an optional depth — so it is part of signature-coupling's default surface.
Reaction reuses signature-coupling's forbidden-type matching (exact resolved path OR `::`-delimited
module prefix), the shared `hunyi::resolve` resolver with the same `BareFallback::Ignore` policy, and
`expand_canonical_paths`, and folds into the same exit-code (0/1/2), `Baseline`, and severity
(`enforce` default / `warn`) contract. The used path SHALL be resolved and canonicalized before
matching, so a re-export reached through a local `pub use` **facade chain** resolves to its defining
path.

#### Scenario: A named public re-export reacts

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra::DbPool;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system emits a violation naming `crate::infra::DbPool`, exposed by the re-export

#### Scenario: A re-export through a facade chain reacts

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::facade::DbPool;` where `crate::facade` declares `pub use crate::infra::DbPool;`, under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system follows the `pub use` chain, canonicalizes to `crate::infra::DbPool`, and reacts, rather than silently passing it

#### Scenario: A clean module re-exporting no forbidden type passes

- **WHEN** the governed module declares only `pub use crate::api::Handle;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system reports no violation

### Requirement: Whole-module re-exports are observed

A re-export whose resolved path is a forbidden **module** (not only a leaf type) SHALL react — it is
the most blatant leak, republishing the whole module under the governed module's path. This SHALL
hold for a **named module re-export** (`pub use crate::infra as fs;`) and for a **`self` group
member** (`pub use crate::infra::{self, DbPool};`, whose `self` re-exports `crate::infra` itself). The
`self` group member SHALL resolve to the prefix module (`crate::infra`, collapsing the trailing
`self`) and be keyed in the seam by the **prefix's final segment** (the name the consumer binds,
`infra`), never the literal `self` — so two distinct `self`-group module re-exports stay distinct
findings. The system SHALL NOT distinguish a re-exported module from a re-exported type: whatever the
resolved path, if it is in/under the forbidden set the re-export reacts.

#### Scenario: A named module re-export reacts

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra as fs;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system emits a violation `crate::infra exposed by pub use crate::domain::fs`, because the whole forbidden module is republished under the name `fs`

#### Scenario: A self-group module re-export reacts, keyed by the module name

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra::{self, DbPool};` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system emits `crate::infra exposed by pub use crate::domain::infra` (the `self` member, keyed by the prefix's final segment `infra`) and `crate::infra::DbPool exposed by pub use crate::domain::DbPool` (the leaf), never a seam keyed by the literal `self`

### Requirement: Re-export findings are seam-qualified by the exported path

A re-export finding SHALL be seam-qualified as `{canonical forbidden type} exposed by pub use
{exported-path}`, where `{exported-path}` is the module-qualified name the re-export publishes (the
alias when `as` is used, otherwise the re-exported leaf name). Two re-exports of the **same** forbidden
type under **different** exported names SHALL therefore produce **distinct** findings, so baselining
one MUST NOT mask the other under the `(target, rule_key, fact)` baseline identity (the one forbidden
false negative). Re-export findings SHALL share the `(target, rule)` of the signature-coupling
boundary (`rule` = "must not expose").

#### Scenario: An aliased re-export is keyed by its exported alias

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra::DbPool as Pool;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the finding is `crate::infra::DbPool exposed by pub use crate::domain::Pool`, keyed by the exported alias `Pool`

#### Scenario: Two aliases of the same forbidden type stay distinct findings

- **WHEN** the governed module declares both `pub use crate::infra::DbPool;` and `pub use crate::infra::DbPool as Pool;`, and the first is recorded in the baseline as accepted
- **THEN** the aliased re-export still reacts: its seam names its own exported path, so the baseline identity does not mask it

#### Scenario: A grouped re-export reacts per leaf

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra::{DbPool, Config};` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system emits one finding per re-exported leaf (`… pub use crate::domain::DbPool` and `… pub use crate::domain::Config`)

### Requirement: Only bare public re-exports are exposure

The system SHALL treat a **bare `pub use`** and a **`pub extern crate`** as public re-export
exposure. A `pub(crate) use`, a `pub(in path) use`, or a private `use` (or a private
`extern crate`) SHALL NOT be a violation, because it does not republish the type on the module's
public surface (it is the re-export analogue of the internal-use exemption). A **`pub extern
crate X [as Y];`** in the governed module republishes the external crate root `X` on the module's
public surface — like `pub use ::X;` — and SHALL react when `X` is in/under the forbidden set; the
exposure names the **real crate `X`** (not the `as`-rename `Y`), seam-qualified `X exposed by pub
extern crate X` (`extern crate self as …` is not an external exposure and is skipped). One form
SHALL remain a **documented non-observed bound (bound: semantic-reexport-exposure/an-underscore-rename-is-a-documented-bound)**, never a silent claim of cleanliness: an
**underscore rename** (`pub use crate::infra::DbPool as _;`) imports a trait's methods without
binding a nameable path, so it exposes no name a consumer can reach through the module.

#### Scenario: A restricted-visibility re-export is not a violation

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub(crate) use crate::infra::DbPool;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system reports no violation, because a `pub(crate)` re-export is not public exposure

#### Scenario: A private use is not a violation

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `use crate::infra::DbPool;` (private, for internal use) under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system reports no violation

#### Scenario: A public extern crate re-export reacts

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub extern crate worklane_core;` (or `pub extern crate worklane_core as wc;`) where `worklane_core` is a declared dependency, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core")`
- **THEN** the system emits `worklane_core exposed by pub extern crate worklane_core`, naming the real crate, because a public extern crate republishes the crate root on the module's public surface

#### Scenario: A private extern crate is not a violation

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `extern crate worklane_core;` (no `pub`) under `must_not_expose("worklane_core")`
- **THEN** the system reports no violation, because a private extern crate does not republish the crate on the public surface

#### Scenario: An underscore rename is a documented bound

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra::DbPool as _;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system does not react — `as _` binds no nameable path a consumer can reach — and this is a stated bound, not a silent claim of cleanliness
- **PINNED-BY** `restricted_and_private_and_underscore_reexports_do_not_react`

### Requirement: Glob re-export reacts on a forbidden root, else a stated bound

For a glob re-export `pub use <root>::*;`, the system SHALL resolve the glob's **root** path (the
path up to the `*`) and match it against the forbidden set: if the root **is in/under** the forbidden
set (`root == entry` or `root` beneath the `entry::` prefix) the system SHALL react — re-exporting an
entire forbidden module or subtree is the most blatant leak and MUST NOT be silent. The finding SHALL
be rendered `{matched root} exposed by pub use {exported-root}::*` (pinned so its baseline identity is
stable). A glob whose root is **not** in/under the forbidden set SHALL be a **documented out-of-scope
bound** (its leaves are not enumerable without resolving the target module's contents — the inherited
glob bound), never a silent claim of cleanliness. This bound has **two sub-cases**, both stated: an
**unrelated/sibling root** (`pub use crate::elsewhere::*`), and — the sharper, foreseeable one — an
**ancestor root** whose glob spans a *deeper* forbidden prefix (`pub use crate::infra::*` under
`must_not_expose("crate::infra::db")`): the glob may surface the forbidden subtree as a child, but the
system cannot tell without enumerating the root's public children, so it stays a stated bound.
Reacting on an ancestor root is deliberately NOT done — it would be a false positive on genuinely
unobservable state (the forbidden child may not be a public re-export at all); closing it requires a
future cross-module-resolution capability, not a guess.

#### Scenario: A glob whose root is forbidden reacts, with a pinned finding

- **WHEN** the governed module `crate::domain` declares `pub use crate::infra::*;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system emits the violation `crate::infra exposed by pub use crate::domain::*`, because the glob's root `crate::infra` is in the forbidden set — the whole forbidden module is re-exported

#### Scenario: A glob whose root is deeper than the forbidden prefix reacts

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra::db::*;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system reacts, because the glob's root `crate::infra::db` is beneath the forbidden `crate::infra` prefix

#### Scenario: A sibling-root glob is a documented bound

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::elsewhere::*;` where `crate::elsewhere` transitively re-exports a `crate::infra` type, under `must_not_expose("crate::infra")`
- **THEN** the system does not claim to observe the transitively re-exported leaf (the inherited glob bound — the glob's leaves are not enumerable here), rather than silently asserting the boundary is clean
- **PINNED-BY** `sibling_root_glob_does_not_react`

#### Scenario: An ancestor-root glob spanning a deeper forbidden prefix is a documented bound

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use crate::infra::*;` under `must_not_expose("crate::infra::db")` (the forbidden prefix is *deeper* than the glob root)
- **THEN** the system treats it as a stated bound (it cannot enumerate whether `crate::infra` publicly re-exports the forbidden `db` subtree), documented as the sharper ancestor-root sub-case rather than lumped with the innocent sibling glob or silently claimed clean
- **PINNED-BY** `ancestor_root_glob_over_a_deeper_forbidden_prefix_does_not_react`

### Requirement: External-crate re-exports are observed by default

A bare `must_not_expose(forbidden)` boundary SHALL observe a named public re-export
(`pub use`) whose first written segment is an **external crate**, and react when the
re-exported path is in/under the forbidden set. This is **on by default**: an extern-rooted
`pub use` republishes the named external type on the module's public surface exactly as a
local re-export republishes a local type — a missed public-surface item, so leaving it silent
is a false negative of the flagship signature-coupling boundary (the one forbidden bug).

The system SHALL determine external-crate-ness from the governed crate's **external-crate name
set**, composed from local-crate AST and declared-manifest data only:

- the crate's **declared dependencies**, read from the `cargo metadata --no-deps` the pipeline
  already consumes (each `dependencies[].name`, substituting `.rename` when present as the name
  written in source), each **normalized `-`→`_`** to match the Rust path spelling (a Cargo name
  `async-trait` is written `async_trait` in a path);
- **plus the sysroot crates** `std`, `core`, `alloc`, `proc_macro`, `test`, which never appear
  in `dependencies` yet are valid extern path heads.

A bare **re-export** (`pub use`) head is resolved against this set **with the governed module's own
child modules excluded** (`externs − child_module_names`): a `pub use dep::X;` head that names a
child `mod dep` **of the re-exporting module** is shadowed by that local module (rustc resolves it to
the local module — E0432 if the path is absent there — not the dependency), so attributing it to the
dependency would be a false positive. The shadow is **per-module**: a same-named module at another
level (e.g. a crate-root `mod dep` while the `pub use dep::X;` lives in a *child* module, where bare
`dep` reaches only the extern prelude) does NOT suppress the re-export — it still reacts (no false
negative). Only child **modules** are excluded, not the whole local type namespace: a same-named
child `mod` is the only shadow that arises in **compiling** code. A local `struct`/`enum`/`trait`/type
named `HEAD` also shadows the `use` head, but makes the re-export itself fail to compile (`HEAD::X` is
then "not a module" — E0433/E0432), so it never occurs in a buildable crate; on compiling code,
subtracting child modules and subtracting the whole type namespace therefore agree, and module-only
is the minimal, most-conservative choice (it also degrades most safely on mid-edit source). A bare
**type-position** head, by contrast, excludes the governed module's whole child-item type namespace
(`semantic-signature-coupling`), since a type-position head may denote any local type-namespace item.
A leading `::` (`pub use ::dep::X;`) bypasses the shadow entirely and resolves to the crate.

This same per-module child-module exclusion SHALL be applied **both** to the direct re-export head
resolution **and** inside the crate-wide re-export **closure** (`collect_reexports`, whose map
`expand_canonical_paths` follows through both maps), keyed by each collected
re-export's own **defining** module, and applied to **both** the external-crate set
(`externs − child_module_names`) **and** the crate-root rename map (`renames − child_module_names`),
exactly as the direct head does. A `pub use dep::X;` (extern-set variant) or `pub use wc::X;`
(crate-root-rename-alias variant) collected in a module `crate::a` that declares a child `mod dep` /
`mod wc` is not recorded as the dependency / renamed crate in the closure, so a **cross-module
facade** that re-exports it onward (`crate::b`'s `pub use crate::a::X;`) does not mis-canonicalize to
the dependency through the closure. A **leading-`::`** re-export (`pub use ::dep::X;`) SHALL bypass
the shadow inside the closure too: the closure honors the `use` item's leading colon and resolves
such a head against the **raw** sets — so the extern escape hatch still reacts through a facade even
under a same-named child `mod dep` (suppressing it would be a false negative). A genuine extern
facade chain — whose defining module declares no same-named child module — still records the extern
hop and reacts. The subtraction is scoped to each module's own declared children during the crate
walk, so the crate-root-vs-child distinction holds inside the closure exactly as it does for the
direct head.

This exclusion — at both the direct head and inside the closure, and on **both** halves named above
— SHALL itself be **cfg-aware**: a same-named child `mod` declaration does NOT shadow a `pub use`
re-export when the two are **provably mutually exclusive** under `#[cfg]`/`cfg_if!` — i.e. they can
never both be present in any single compiled configuration, so the local module never actually wins
name resolution over the extern prelude (nor the extern prelude's rename alias) for that `pub use`'s
own build. "Provably mutually exclusive" covers exactly two syntactic shapes, proven without a
general `cfg`-predicate satisfiability engine: (1) the `mod` and the `pub use` are two different
arms of the IDENTICAL `cfg_if!` invocation (its arms are exclusive by construction — only one
predicate in the `if`/`else if`/`else` chain is ever true); (2) each carries exactly one bare
`#[cfg(...)]` attribute and the two predicates are syntactic negations of one another (`#[cfg(P)]`
on one, `#[cfg(not(P))]` on the other, compared structurally — immune to a whitespace/formatting
difference, not by source text). **The `not` wrapper SHALL be recognized by the name it spells, not
by its written spelling**: `r#not` is a raw-identifier spelling of `not` and names the same
predicate, so `#[cfg(r#not(P))]` SHALL be the negation of `#[cfg(P)]` exactly as `#[cfg(not(P))]`
is. This is the same rule the enclosed predicates already carry — their segments are compared with
the raw prefix stripped, so what the wrapper's own comparison had been doing is answering differently
about one grammar from the halves it encloses. That is written as the reason and not as a further
SHALL: what reacts is the `not` wrapper's recognition, and a clause reaching every comparison in that
family would assert structure nothing observes.
The direction the rule protects is the forbidden one, not a noisy one: this exclusion
decides whether a same-named child `mod` genuinely shadows a `pub use`'s bare head, so a negation
read as no negation leaves that shadow standing, the re-export is never resolved against the extern
prelude, and its exposure is dropped rather than over-reported. When either holds, the `mod`'s name is NOT subtracted from **either**
the external-crate-name set **or** the crate-root rename map for that specific `pub use`'s own
resolution, even though both declarations live in the same governed/defining module and the same
crate-wide-closure pass observes both. The rename-map half is not a cosmetic mirror of the
extern-name half: `extern_verbatim_renamed` (the resolver both the direct head and the closure use)
checks the rename map **before** falling back to the extern-name set, and a rename alias (e.g. `wc`
from `extern crate serde as wc;`) is never itself a member of the extern-name set — only the real
crate name (`serde`) is. So leaving the rename-map half cfg-blind while fixing only the extern-name
half would not merely under-shadow a rename-aliased re-export; it would drop its resolution outright,
since the shadowed alias falls through to an extern-name-set fallback holding no candidate for it at
all. Anything less syntactically direct than the two proven shapes above — unrelated predicates (e.g.
`cfg(windows)` beside `cfg(target_os = "macos")`), arms of two *different* `cfg_if!` invocations, or
more than one bare `#[cfg]` attribute stacked on either the `mod` or the `pub use` — SHALL remain the
pre-existing cfg-blind default (the `mod` still shadows, on both halves): a stated, conservative
residual bound, not a guess dressed as an observation. The **unconditional** case this requirement's
own rustc rationale was written for — a `mod` and a `pub use` with no `#[cfg]` gating at all,
genuinely compiled together in every build — is unaffected on either half: the shadow still applies
exactly as before. A bare **type-position** head's own use of the rename map (see the rename
requirement below) is a SEPARATE, narrower shadow (governed by `semantic-signature-coupling`'s own
whole-type-namespace exclusion, not this re-export-only cfg-aware carve-out) and stays cfg-blind — an
explicit, distinct non-goal, not an oversight this carve-out forgot.

The system SHALL additionally apply a **source-level crate-root `extern crate X as Y;` rename**:
a crate-root `extern crate` item with an `as`-rename binds `Y` crate-wide (the extern prelude),
so a head `Y` SHALL be mapped to the real crate `X` **before** the external-crate check, resolving
`Y::…` to the verbatim `X::…` path. This is read from the local AST (unlike `cargo metadata`, which
does not parse source `extern crate` renames), and is applied in the signature-coupling exposure
pipeline, covering a renamed head in a **type position** and in the **governed module's own
`pub use`**. Only a **crate-root** rename is collected — a module-scoped `extern crate … as …`
binds only within its module, so collecting it crate-wide would be a false positive (a stated bound (bound: semantic-reexport-exposure/a-module-scoped-extern-crate-rename-is-a-documented-bound)
below).

The rename SHALL be resolved rustc-correctly in three positions of the head:

- **Bare head `Y::…`** — rewritten to `X::…`, **unless** the governed module declares its own child
  `mod Y`, which rustc lets shadow the extern alias within that module (bare `Y::…` is then the local
  module, not the crate). The rewrite is therefore applied with the governed module's own
  child-module names removed from the rename map. A bare `Y::…` in a module with **no** local `mod Y`
  still rewrites and reacts (suppressing it there would be a false negative). Only child **modules**
  shadow a `Y::…` path head — the sole shadow that arises in compiling code (a non-module local `Y`
  makes `Y::…` uncompilable).
- **Crate-relative spelling `crate::Y::…`** — rewritten to `X::…`. `crate::Y` unambiguously names the
  crate-root extern rename (a crate-root `mod Y` cannot coexist with `extern crate … as Y`), so no
  shadow applies and the rewrite is unconditional; only the segment **immediately** after `crate` is
  treated as the alias (a deeper `crate::m::Y` is a submodule item, not the rename). The rewrite is
  applied to the **final** resolved path (after the alias/re-export closure), so a `crate::Y::…`
  reached directly, through a `type` alias, or through a `pub use` target reacts alike.
- **Leading-`::` `::Y::…`** — an unambiguous extern, rewritten to `X::…` regardless of any local `mod Y`.

A bare head in this set resolves to its **verbatim** path; a bare head not in it keeps its
existing non-resolving behavior. The determination SHALL be applied in the bare-fallback branch
**after** `use`-map and `crate`/`self`/`super` resolution, so a local `use … as <depname>`
alias still wins. Matching reuses the exact-or-`::`-prefix comparison,
`expand_canonical_paths`, and the same exit-code / `Baseline` / severity /
seam-qualification contract. The forbidden operand is the extern path **as written in the
governed source** (for a renamed dependency, the in-source name); **no DSL change**.

#### Scenario: A bare dependency-rooted re-export reacts

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core::spi::Foo;` where `worklane_core` is a declared dependency, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system emits `worklane_core::spi::Foo exposed by pub use <module>::Foo`

#### Scenario: A hyphenated dependency is matched under its underscore path spelling

- **WHEN** the crate depends on `async-trait` and the governed module declares `pub use async_trait::Thing;`, under `must_not_expose("async_trait")`
- **THEN** the system reacts, because the dependency name is normalized `-`→`_` to the path spelling

#### Scenario: A sysroot-crate re-export reacts

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use std::sync::Mutex;` under `must_not_expose("std::sync")`
- **THEN** the system reacts, because `std` is in the external-crate set though it is not a declared dependency

#### Scenario: An aliased dependency-rooted re-export is keyed by its exported alias

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core::spi::Foo as Bar;` under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the finding is `worklane_core::spi::Foo exposed by pub use <module>::Bar`, keyed by the alias so two aliases of the same extern type stay distinct under the baseline

#### Scenario: A grouped dependency-rooted re-export reacts per leaf

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core::spi::{Foo, Bar};` under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system emits one finding per re-exported leaf

#### Scenario: A single-segment crate-root re-export reacts when the crate is forbidden

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core;` (or `pub use worklane_core as wc;`) where `worklane_core` is a declared dependency, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core")`
- **THEN** the system reacts — the whole forbidden dependency crate is republished

#### Scenario: A same-named local module does not suppress a subtree's extern re-export

- **WHEN** the governed crate declares a crate-root `mod worklane_core { … }` AND also depends on a crate `worklane_core`, and a **child** module `crate::domain` declares `pub use worklane_core::Foo;`
- **THEN** the system reacts, because the shadow is per-module: `crate::domain` (the re-exporting module) declares no child `mod worklane_core`, so `worklane_core` is not excluded from its re-export extern set — the crate-root module shadows only in the root module itself, not in a child, and suppressing here would be a false negative

#### Scenario: A cross-module facade reaching a child-shadowed head does not react

- **WHEN** `crate::a` declares both `pub use worklane_core::spi::Foo;` and a child `mod worklane_core { … }` (rustc resolves the bare head to the local module — E0432 if the path is absent there), and the governed facade module `crate::b` re-exports it onward with `pub use crate::a::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")` (the dependency)
- **THEN** the system does not misattribute the facade to the dependency: `crate::a`'s own child module `worklane_core` is excluded from its re-export extern set when the crate-wide closure collects `crate::a`'s re-exports, so the closure does not record `crate::a::Foo → worklane_core::spi::Foo`, and canonicalizing `crate::b::Foo` through the closure does not reach the dependency — no violation is emitted

#### Scenario: A cross-module facade reaching a rename-alias child-shadowed head does not react

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` is declared, `crate::a` declares both `pub use wc::spi::Foo;` and a child `mod wc { … }` (which rustc lets shadow the bare alias head within `crate::a`; a submodule `mod wc` does not conflict with the crate-root rename), and the governed facade module `crate::b` re-exports it onward with `pub use crate::a::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system does not misattribute the facade to the renamed crate: `crate::a`'s own child module `wc` is removed from the rename map for `crate::a`'s bare re-export heads when the crate-wide closure collects `crate::a`'s re-exports, so the closure does not record `crate::a::Foo → worklane_core::spi::Foo`, and canonicalizing `crate::b::Foo` through the closure does not reach the renamed crate — no violation is emitted

#### Scenario: A leading-colon facade hop reacts through the closure despite a child module

- **WHEN** `crate::a` declares both `pub use ::worklane_core::spi::Foo;` (a leading-`::` extern head, which a same-named child module does not shadow) and a child `mod worklane_core { … }`, and the governed module `crate::b` re-exports it onward with `pub use crate::a::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system reacts: the closure honors the `use` item's leading colon and resolves the `::worklane_core` head against the raw external-crate set (unshadowed by the child `mod worklane_core`), so it records `crate::a::Foo → worklane_core::spi::Foo` and canonicalizes `crate::b::Foo` through the closure to the dependency

#### Scenario: A genuine extern facade chain still reacts through the closure

- **WHEN** `crate::facade` declares `pub use worklane_core::spi::Foo;` and declares **no** child `mod worklane_core`, and the governed module `crate::domain` declares `pub use crate::facade::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system reacts: `crate::facade`'s re-export extern set retains `worklane_core` (no same-named child module), so the closure records the extern hop and canonicalizes `crate::domain::Foo` to `worklane_core::spi::Foo` — the child-module exclusion is per defining module and does not suppress a genuine extern facade (no false negative)

#### Scenario: A source-level crate-root extern-crate rename resolves and reacts

- **WHEN** the governed crate declares a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` and a module declares `pub use wc::spi::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system maps `wc` to `worklane_core` (read from the local AST) and emits `worklane_core::spi::Foo exposed by pub use <module>::Foo`, rather than silently passing it

#### Scenario: A source-level extern-crate rename in a type position resolves and reacts

- **WHEN** the governed crate declares a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` and the governed module declares `pub fn make() -> wc::spi::Foo`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system resolves `wc::spi::Foo` to `worklane_core::spi::Foo` and reacts, matching the re-export spelling

#### Scenario: A dependency-rooted re-export outside the forbidden set passes

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core::api::Handle;` under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system reports no violation (neither the forbidden path nor beneath `worklane_core::spi::`)

#### Scenario: A renamed dependency is observed under its in-source name

- **WHEN** the crate declares `wc = { package = "worklane_core" }` and a module declares `pub use wc::spi::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("wc::spi")`
- **THEN** the system reacts, matching the path as written (`wc`, from `.rename`); declaring the operand under the real crate name `worklane_core::spi` would not match — the stated as-written semantics

#### Scenario: A mutually-exclusive bare-#[cfg] sibling module does not shadow the re-export

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `#[cfg(unix)] mod serde;` and `#[cfg(not(unix))] pub use serde::Value;`, where `serde` is a declared dependency (and `src/<module>/serde.rs` exists, backing the `unix`-gated `mod`), under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system reacts, emitting `serde::Value exposed by pub use <module>::Value`: the `unix`-gated `mod serde` and the `not(unix)`-gated `pub use` are syntactic negations of one another and so provably never compile together, meaning the `mod` never actually shadows this `pub use`'s own build — unlike the unconditional case (no `#[cfg]` on either), where the identical pair genuinely coexists and the `mod` does shadow it

#### Scenario: A raw-identifier spelling of the negation is the same negation

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `#[cfg(unix)] mod serde;` and `#[cfg(r#not(unix))] pub use serde::Value;`, `serde` a declared dependency (and `src/<module>/serde.rs` exists), under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system reacts identically to the `not(unix)` spelling, emitting `serde::Value exposed by pub use <module>::Value`: `r#not` names `not`, so the pair is provably mutually exclusive and the `unix`-gated `mod` does not shadow this `pub use`'s own build
- **AND** the failure this closes is the dropped observation rather than an extra one — read as no negation, the shadow stands and the finding set is **empty**

#### Scenario: A mutually-exclusive cfg_if arm sibling module does not shadow the re-export

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `cfg_if! { if #[cfg(unix)] { mod serde; } else { pub use serde::Value; } }`, `serde` a declared dependency, under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system reacts identically to the bare-`#[cfg]` form: the `mod` and the `pub use` are two arms of one `cfg_if!` invocation, provably never compiled together, so the `mod` does not shadow the `pub use`

#### Scenario: A mutually-exclusive sibling module does not shadow a facade's extern re-export through the closure

- **WHEN** `crate::a` declares `#[cfg(unix)] mod serde;` and `#[cfg(not(unix))] pub use serde::Value;` (`serde` a declared dependency), and the governed module `crate::domain` declares `pub use crate::a::Value;`, under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system follows the closure to `serde::Value` and reacts: `crate::a`'s own `mod serde` does not suppress `crate::a`'s genuine re-export inside the crate-wide closure either, matching the direct-head behavior for the identical mutually-exclusive pair — the facade does not silently canonicalize to nothing

#### Scenario: An unconditional child module still shadows the re-export

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `mod serde { … }` and `pub use serde::Value;` with **no** `#[cfg]` on either — the unconditional case this requirement's shadow rule was originally written for, both genuinely coexisting in every build — under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system does not react: the `mod` and the `pub use` compile together in every build, so the shadow applies exactly as it did before the cfg-mutual-exclusion carve-out — that carve-out narrows the shadow only for a provably-exclusive pair, never the unconditional case

#### Scenario: A mutually-exclusive bare-#[cfg] sibling module does not shadow a rename-aliased re-export

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate serde as wc;` is declared, and the governed module declares `#[cfg(unix)] mod wc;` and `#[cfg(not(unix))] pub use wc::Value;`, under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system reacts, emitting `serde::Value exposed by pub use <module>::Value`: the `unix`-gated `mod wc` and the `not(unix)`-gated `pub use` are syntactic negations of one another and so provably never compile together, meaning the `mod` never shadows the rename alias `wc` for this `pub use`'s own build — the rename-map half of the shadow gets the identical carve-out the extern-name half does, not merely a weaker or absent one

#### Scenario: A mutually-exclusive cfg_if arm sibling module does not shadow a rename-aliased re-export

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate serde as wc;` is declared, and the governed module declares `cfg_if! { if #[cfg(unix)] { mod wc; } else { pub use wc::Value; } }`, under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system reacts identically to the bare-`#[cfg]` form: the `mod` and the `pub use` are two arms of one `cfg_if!` invocation, provably never compiled together, so the `mod` does not shadow the rename alias `wc`

#### Scenario: A mutually-exclusive sibling module does not shadow a facade's rename-aliased re-export through the closure

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate serde as wc;` is declared, `crate::a` declares `#[cfg(unix)] mod wc;` and `#[cfg(not(unix))] pub use wc::Value;`, and the governed module `crate::domain` declares `pub use crate::a::Value;`, under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system follows the closure to `serde::Value` and reacts: `crate::a`'s own `mod wc` does not suppress `crate::a`'s genuine rename-aliased re-export inside the crate-wide closure either, matching the direct-head behavior for the identical mutually-exclusive pair

#### Scenario: An unconditional child module still shadows a rename-aliased re-export

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate serde as wc;` is declared, and the governed module declares `mod wc { … }` and `pub use wc::Value;` with **no** `#[cfg]` on either — both genuinely coexisting in every build — under `must_not_expose("serde")`
- **THEN** the system does not react: the `mod` and the `pub use` compile together in every build, so the rename-alias shadow applies exactly as it did before the cfg-mutual-exclusion carve-out

### Requirement: A local facade chain of inline re-exports terminating at an extern type reacts

The system SHALL follow a local public re-export facade chain **composed of inline `pub use`
path hops** that terminates at an external-crate type, and react to it — restoring for extern
endpoints the facade-chain guarantee already given for local endpoints. The re-export closure
SHALL retain an extern-headed target (head ∈ the external-crate set) so the chain canonicalizes
to the forbidden extern type rather than being dropped. A hop written as a re-export of a
privately-`use`d bare name (`use dep::spi::Foo; pub use Foo;`) is NOT captured (the closure
follows inline `pub use` paths only) — an inherited stated bound (bound: semantic-reexport-exposure/a-facade-hop-re-exporting-a-privately-used-bare-name-is-a-stated-bound), not a silent claim.

#### Scenario: A facade chain of inline re-exports to an extern type is followed

- **WHEN** the governed module `crate::domain` declares `pub use crate::facade::Foo;`, and `crate::facade` declares `pub use worklane_core::spi::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system follows the local chain, canonicalizes to `worklane_core::spi::Foo`, and reacts

#### Scenario: A facade hop re-exporting a privately-used bare name is a stated bound

- **WHEN** `crate::facade` declares `use worklane_core::spi::Foo; pub use Foo;` (private import then bare re-export), re-exported onward by `crate::domain`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system does not follow that hop (the closure captures only inline `pub use` paths) and this is a documented inherited bound, not silently claimed clean
- **PINNED-BY** `facade_hop_reexporting_a_privately_used_bare_name_is_a_stated_bound`

### Requirement: External resolution has stated residual bounds

The system SHALL treat the following as **documented out-of-scope bounds**, never a silent
claim of cleanliness, because closing them needs observation not available from the local-crate
AST + declared manifest:

- A **glob over an external module whose root is not in/under the forbidden set**
  (`pub use worklane_core::spi::*;` under a disjoint operand): its leaves are not enumerable
  without the foreign module's contents. A glob whose **root** is in/under the forbidden set
  still reacts.
- A re-export **routed/renamed through a foreign module** (`pub use worklane_core::prelude::Foo;`
  where the foreign `prelude` re-exports `worklane_core::spi::Foo`): the written path is matched
  as-is; following it into the foreign crate needs its AST.
- A **module-scoped `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` rename** (declared inside `mod m { … }`,
  not at the crate root): its alias binds only within `m`, so it is not collected into the
  crate-wide rename map (collecting it would false-positive on a same-named head elsewhere). A
  **crate-root** `extern crate … as …` rename, by contrast, binds crate-wide via the extern
  prelude and is resolved wherever it is reached **as a bare head** (`wc::…`) — directly in a
  signature or re-export, **through a type alias** (`type H = wc::Foo;`), and **through a `pub use`
  facade closure** — because the (pre-collected) rename map is threaded into the exposure query, the
  alias-target resolution, and the re-export closure alike. Its bare head, crate-relative spelling
  (`crate::wc::…`), and submodule-shadow suppression are all resolved rustc-correctly (see the
  crate-root-rename clause of "External-crate re-exports are observed by default"); only the
  *module-scoped* rename remains a bound.
- A dependency that renames its **`[lib] name`** to a spelling not derivable from its package
  name (e.g. package `foo-thing` with `[lib] name = "foobar"`, imported as `foobar`): the
  foreign crate's target name lives in *its* manifest, absent from this crate's
  `cargo metadata --no-deps`, so `foobar` is not in the external set. (A `-`→`_` normalization is
  applied, so the common `foo-thing` → `foo_thing` case *is* covered; only a genuinely distinct
  `[lib] name` is the bound.)
- An **edition-2015 bare crate-root-relative re-export naming a local module** not shadowing a
  dependency (`pub use foo::Bar;`, `foo` local): the pre-2018 relative-path form — an inherited
  bound.

#### Scenario: A non-forbidden-root external glob is a documented bound

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core::spi::*;` under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::other")`
- **THEN** the system does not claim to observe the glob's individual leaves, rather than silently asserting the boundary is clean
- **PINNED-BY** `extern_glob_nonforbidden_root_is_a_stated_bound`

#### Scenario: A forbidden-root external glob reacts on the root

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core::spi::*;` under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system reacts on the glob root `worklane_core::spi`, consistent with the local forbidden-root glob rule

#### Scenario: A re-export renamed through a foreign module is a documented bound

- **WHEN** the governed module declares `pub use worklane_core::prelude::Foo;` where the foreign `worklane_core::prelude` re-exports `worklane_core::spi::Foo`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system matches only the written path (`worklane_core::prelude::Foo`, not in/under the forbidden set) and does not silently claim to have followed the foreign chain
- **PINNED-BY** `foreign_prelude_rename_is_a_stated_bound`

#### Scenario: A crate-root extern-crate rename reached through a type alias resolves and reacts

- **WHEN** the governed crate declares a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` and the governed module declares `type H = wc::spi::Foo;` exposed by `pub fn make() -> H`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system resolves the alias target through the rename to `worklane_core::spi::Foo` and emits a violation — the rename is honored in alias-target resolution, not only in a directly-written signature

#### Scenario: A crate-root extern-crate rename reached through a facade closure resolves and reacts

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` is declared, `crate::facade` declares `pub use wc::spi::Foo;`, and the governed module `crate::domain` declares `pub use crate::facade::Foo;`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system follows the re-export closure through the rename to `worklane_core::spi::Foo` and emits a violation

#### Scenario: A module-scoped extern-crate rename is a documented bound

- **WHEN** the governed crate declares `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` **inside** a module `mod m { … }` (not at the crate root) and `m` declares `pub fn make() -> wc::spi::Foo`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system does not resolve `wc` to `worklane_core` (only crate-root renames are collected, since a module-scoped alias binds only locally) and this is a documented bound, distinct from the handled crate-root rename
- **PINNED-BY** `module_scoped_extern_crate_rename_is_a_stated_bound`

#### Scenario: A crate-root rename reached by its crate-relative spelling reacts

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` is declared and the governed module exposes `worklane_core::spi::Foo` written as `crate::wc::spi::Foo` (the crate-relative spelling of the alias), under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system rewrites `crate::wc::…` to `worklane_core::…` (the segment immediately after `crate` is the crate-root rename alias) and emits a violation

#### Scenario: A bare alias head shadowed by a submodule's own child module does not react

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` is declared and a governed submodule that also declares a child `mod wc { … }` exposes `wc::spi::Foo` (which rustc resolves to the local `mod wc`, not the crate), under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system does not rewrite the bare `wc` head to `worklane_core` (the alias is removed from the rename map for that module's bare heads under its child-module shadow), so it does not misattribute the local path to the dependency

#### Scenario: A bare alias head with no local shadow still reacts

- **WHEN** a crate-root `extern crate worklane_core as wc;` is declared and a governed submodule with **no** local `mod wc` exposes `wc::spi::Foo`, under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system rewrites the bare `wc` head to `worklane_core::spi::Foo` and emits a violation — the crate-wide bare rewrite is preserved (suppressing it here would be a false negative)

#### Scenario: A re-export head shadowed by a same-named local module does not react

- **WHEN** the governed module declares both `pub use worklane_core::spi::Foo;` and a local child `mod worklane_core { … }` (which rustc lets shadow the extern head — E0432 if the path is absent there), under `must_not_expose("worklane_core::spi")`
- **THEN** the system does not misattribute the `worklane_core` head to the dependency: the re-exporting module's own child module `worklane_core` is excluded from its re-export extern set, so the head is not resolved as the dependency and no violation is emitted (a genuine extern re-export coexisting with the local module is still reachable via `pub use ::worklane_core::spi::Foo;`)

### Requirement: Re-export identity is the exported public seam

A re-export exposure fact SHALL encode its forbidden subject and exported module/name path as
separate structured roles. Private source path spelling and human rendering SHALL NOT define the
public seam identity.

#### Scenario: Two exported names stay distinct
- **WHEN** the same subject is re-exported under two public names
- **THEN** the exported-path fields produce two identities
