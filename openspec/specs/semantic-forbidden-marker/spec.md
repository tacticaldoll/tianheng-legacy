# semantic-forbidden-marker Specification

## Purpose

The 渾儀 (semantic) dimension's forbidden-marker capability: types **defined in a governed module subtree** must not acquire a forbidden trait — observed as a `#[derive(T)]` on the type or a hand `impl T for X` (anywhere in the crate) whose self-type resolves to a definition under the subtree. It delivers the "this layer is not `T`-able" intent (both idiomatic acquisition forms), the forbidden-marker complement to exposure, impl-locality, and visibility. Matching is by leaf identifier (no false negative across the derive-macro/trait path split); the forbidden-attribute slice stays deferred.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Forbidden-marker boundary declared in Rust

A forbidden-marker boundary SHALL be expressed as Rust code and is part of the single source of truth. A `ForbiddenMarkerBoundary` SHALL name a target crate, a governed **module subtree** (a module-path prefix), a forbidden-trait set (one or more trait names/paths), a human-readable reason, and a severity. The system MUST NOT require TOML, YAML, Markdown, or any generated policy file.

#### Scenario: Boundary declared in Rust

- **WHEN** a developer writes `ForbiddenMarkerBoundary::in_crate("app").module("crate::domain").must_not_acquire("serde::Serialize").because("domain types are not serializable")`
- **THEN** a boundary is held, governing the subtree `crate::domain`, forbidding acquisition of `serde::Serialize`, with a non-empty reason and a default `enforce` severity

### Requirement: Subtree scope by type definition

A type SHALL be governed by the boundary iff its **definition** is under the anchor's module-subtree prefix (`::`-delimited containment, sibling-safe — `crate::domain` covers `crate::domain::order` but not `crate::domainx`). The governed set therefore spans the whole subtree, not only the anchor module's direct items.

#### Scenario: A type in a submodule of the subtree is governed

- **WHEN** the boundary governs `crate::domain` and `crate::domain::order` defines `struct Order`
- **THEN** `Order` is governed (a type defined anywhere under the subtree counts)

#### Scenario: A prefix-colliding sibling is not governed

- **WHEN** the boundary governs `crate::domain` and a type is defined in `crate::domainx`
- **THEN** that type is not governed (`::`-delimited containment does not treat the sibling as under the subtree)

### Requirement: Both acquisition forms react

The system SHALL react when a governed type acquires a forbidden trait by **either** form: a `#[derive(T)]` on the type's declaration, **or** an `impl T for X` block anywhere in the crate whose self-type `X` resolves to a definition under the subtree. Covering both is required — a derive-only or impl-only rule would silently pass the other idiomatic form. A `#[cfg_attr(<pred>, derive(T))]` SHALL be read (the nested derive, cfg-agnostic), including a **nested** `#[cfg_attr(a, cfg_attr(b, derive(T)))]`.

#### Scenario: A forbidden derive on a subtree type reacts

- **WHEN** `crate::domain::order` declares `#[derive(serde::Serialize)] pub struct Order;` under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize` on `crate::domain`
- **THEN** the system emits a violation identifying `derive serde::Serialize on crate::domain::order::Order` (the finding uses the type's canonical path, so two same-named types stay distinct)

#### Scenario: A forbidden hand-impl for a subtree type reacts

- **WHEN** `crate::wire` declares `impl serde::Serialize for crate::domain::Order { … }` (a hand impl, no derive) under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize` on `crate::domain`
- **THEN** the system emits a violation identifying `impl serde::Serialize for crate::domain::Order in crate::wire` (the impl form names the impl-site module), because `Order`'s definition is under the subtree — even though the impl is written outside it

#### Scenario: A hand-impl through a re-export or type-alias spelling reacts

- **WHEN** `crate::wire` re-exports the governed type (`pub use crate::domain::Order;`) and declares `impl serde::Serialize for crate::wire::Order { … }`, or a `type Bar = crate::domain::Order;` alias is written `impl serde::Serialize for Bar`, under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize` on `crate::domain`
- **THEN** the system follows the re-export and type-alias closures to the definition `crate::domain::Order` (a re-export/alias denotes the same type — to coherence the marker lands on the definition) and reacts, identifying the impl by its written self-type spelling and impl-site module (`impl serde::Serialize for crate::wire::Order in crate::wire`), rather than silently passing the facade/alias spelling

#### Scenario: A cfg_attr-wrapped derive reacts

- **WHEN** a governed type declares `#[cfg_attr(feature = "serde", derive(serde::Serialize))] pub struct Order;` under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize`
- **THEN** the system emits a violation (the nested derive is read, cfg-agnostic), rather than silently passing the optional-serde shape

#### Scenario: A nested cfg_attr derive reacts

- **WHEN** a governed type declares `#[cfg_attr(all(), cfg_attr(all(), derive(serde::Serialize)))] pub struct Order;`
- **THEN** the system recurses into the nested `cfg_attr` and emits a violation, rather than silently dropping the derive

#### Scenario: A raw-identifier spelling of derive or of its cfg_attr wrapper reacts

- **WHEN** a governed type carries `#[r#derive(serde::Serialize)]`, `#[r#cfg_attr(unix, derive(serde::Serialize))]`, or `#[cfg_attr(unix, r#derive(serde::Serialize))]`, and `serde::Serialize` is forbidden on that subtree
- **THEN** each reacts, because `r#` changes an identifier's lexical spelling and not the name it spells — measured under rustc 1.96.0, edition 2021, `--crate-type lib`, all three declarations apply the derive, and a marker this reader does not see is one this capability cannot refuse
- **PINNED-BY** `a_raw_identifier_derive_reacts_in_every_spelling_rustc_applies`

#### Scenario: A non-forbidden trait is clean

- **WHEN** a governed type derives or impls only traits not in the forbidden set
- **THEN** the system reports no violation

#### Scenario: A type-alias landing reached through a mutually-exclusive cfg-gated use alias reacts

- **WHEN** an impl site declares `#[cfg(unix)] use crate::domain::Order as Y; #[cfg(not(unix))] use crate::domain::NotOrder as Y; type X = Y; impl serde::Serialize for X {}`, where `Order` is a subtree-defined type and `NotOrder` is not defined anywhere, under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize` on the subtree, in either declaration order
- **THEN** the system emits a violation, regardless of which `use` line is written first — every landing candidate for `X` is checked against the defined/under-subtree gate, so the genuinely governed candidate (`Order`) is never dropped in favor of the undefined one (`NotOrder`) merely because it was declared first

### Requirement: Trait matching by leaf identifier

A forbidden entry SHALL match a derive/trait path by **leaf identifier** — so a forbidden `Serialize` or `serde::Serialize` matches `#[derive(Serialize)]`, `#[derive(serde::Serialize)]`, `#[derive(serde_derive::Serialize)]`, and `impl serde::Serialize for …` alike (the derive-macro re-export path and the trait path share a leaf, and the resolver is cross-crate-blind, so leaf is what reliably catches acquisition). The compared leaf is taken from the path **resolved through the acquisition site's `use`-map**, so a locally renamed trait or derive — `use serde::Serialize as Ser; impl Ser for …` or `#[derive(Ser)]` — resolves to its true leaf `Serialize` and reacts (a local rename is observable, so a missed one would be a false negative); a path that does not resolve locally — a bare/prelude name or a cross-crate path — falls back to its **written** leaf, keeping the match cross-crate-blind (the derive-macro-crate path `serde_derive::Serialize` still matches by the leaf `Serialize`). A path-qualified forbidden entry is accepted for the author's clarity but does **not** narrow the match — narrowing by resolved path would silently miss the derive-macro-crate path (`serde_derive::Serialize`), the exact false negative the contract forbids. The cost is a documented false **positive** when two traits share a leaf — reportable, and the safe direction, since a false negative is the one forbidden bug. When the acquisition site's `use`-map resolves the derive/trait name to **more than one** candidate — a mutually-exclusive `#[cfg]`-gated `use` alias for the identical local name — every candidate's leaf SHALL be checked and the match SHALL react if any candidate's leaf matches, never silently keeping only the leaf of whichever declaration was written last (observation cannot know which `#[cfg]` branch is live). A forbidden entry whose **leaf itself would be empty** — a trailing `::` (`"serde::"`), a doubled `::`, or the empty string — SHALL be rejected as a constitution error rather than silently compared: leaf-identifier matching is immune to a *leading* `::` (`leaf_of("::serde::Serialize")` is still the real leaf `Serialize`), but not to a *trailing* one, since no real identifier is ever empty and such an entry could therefore never match anything, in the same silent-pass class signature-coupling's own forbidden-operand validation closes for its own (full-path) matching mechanism.

#### Scenario: A derive-macro-crate path still reacts

- **WHEN** a governed type declares `#[derive(serde_derive::Serialize)] pub struct Order;` under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize`
- **THEN** the system emits a violation, matched by leaf identifier (the derive-macro path `serde_derive::Serialize` would not resolve to the trait path, but the leaf `Serialize` matches), rather than a false negative

#### Scenario: A same-leaf different trait is a documented false positive

- **WHEN** a governed type derives `rkyv::Serialize` under a boundary forbidding the bare `Serialize`
- **THEN** the system reacts (a leaf match); the user may path-qualify the forbidden entry to tighten — a reportable false positive is accepted, never a silent false negative

#### Scenario: A locally renamed trait or derive reacts by its true leaf

- **WHEN** `crate::domain::order` declares `use serde::Serialize as Ser; #[derive(Ser)] pub struct Order;` (or a hand impl `impl Ser for crate::domain::Order`) under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize` on `crate::domain`
- **THEN** the system resolves `Ser` through the module's `use`-map to `serde::Serialize` and reacts by the leaf `Serialize` (the finding renders the written spelling, `derive Ser on crate::domain::order::Order`), rather than silently passing the rename

#### Scenario: Two mutually-exclusive cfg-gated use aliases for a derive or trait name both react

- **WHEN** a governed type's module declares `#[cfg(unix)] use bad::Marker as M; #[cfg(not(unix))] use good::NotBad as M;` and derives `#[derive(M)]` (or an impl site declares the identical alias collision and writes `impl M for <the type>`), under a boundary forbidding `bad::Marker`, in either declaration order
- **THEN** the system emits a violation, regardless of which `use` line is written first — the verdict never depends on source order

#### Scenario: A trailing-`::` forbidden entry is a constitution error

- **WHEN** a boundary declares `must_not_acquire("serde::")` (trailing `::`)
- **THEN** the system reports a constitution error (exit 2), rather than silently reporting the boundary satisfied — the computed leaf would be empty and could never match a real identifier

#### Scenario: A leading-`::` forbidden entry is rejected for DSL-wide consistency, not because it would mismatch

- **WHEN** a boundary declares `must_not_acquire("::serde::Serialize")` (leading `::`) against a type deriving `#[derive(serde::Serialize)]`
- **THEN** the system reports a constitution error (exit 2) — leaf-identifier matching alone would tolerate a leading `::` (`leaf_of` still yields `Serialize`), but the operand is rejected anyway, for consistency with every other forbidden/allowed-operand-shaped DSL method in this family, none of which assigns the leading-`::` spelling a meaning distinct from the bare form

### Requirement: Anchor resolution and observation bounds

If the boundary's target crate is absent from the workspace, the system SHALL treat it as a constitution error (exit 2). An acquisition the syntactic scan cannot observe — a derive/impl produced by a macro, or a hand-impl whose self-type cannot be resolved to a subtree definition (a glob/external/complex-generic self-type) — is OUT OF SCOPE, a stated coverage bound, not a claimed reaction; `#[cfg]`-gated code is observed as written. A module reached only through a `cfg_attr`-wrapped `#[path]` remap IS followed: an inline body regardless of the attribute (which has no effect on an inline module's content), and a file module's conventional file and its `cfg_attr` target both read when they exist on disk, a cfg-blind union rather than a skip bound — matching the already-followed **unconditional** `#[path = "…"]` form. A `#[derive(...)]` whose arguments fail to parse SHALL be a scan error (exit 2), never a silent skip. Within the observed scope there SHALL be no false negative.

#### Scenario: An unresolvable hand-impl self-type is a documented bound

- **WHEN** a hand-impl's self-type is brought in by a glob import (`use crate::domain::*; impl serde::Serialize for Order`) so the scan cannot resolve `Order` to its definition
- **THEN** the system does not claim to observe it (a stated coverage bound), rather than silently asserting cleanliness — the co-located, `use`-imported, re-export-spelled, and type-alias cases (the common ones) do resolve and react
- **PINNED-BY** `an_unresolvable_glob_self_type_is_a_documented_bound`

#### Scenario: A blanket impl's own generic parameter is never resolved through a same-named alias

- **WHEN** a module declares a blanket `impl<T> Marker for T {}` and ALSO declares an unrelated `use <some path> as T;` naming a real subtree-defined type
- **THEN** the system does not react — `T` in the impl header is the impl's own declared generic type parameter, not a nominal self-type, so it is never resolved through the module's same-named `use ... as T` alias merely because both share the identifier `T`; the source never writes an impl for the aliased type at all

#### Scenario: The shadow holds through a projection off the impl's own generic parameter

- **WHEN** a module declares a blanket `impl<T> Marker for T::Assoc {}` (a projection off the impl's own parameter, never a nominal type) and ALSO declares an unrelated `use <some path> as T;` naming a real subtree-defined type
- **THEN** the system does not react — the shadow applies to the self type's LEADING segment regardless of how many further segments follow (`T::Assoc`, not only the bare `T` form), so it is never resolved through the alias merely because the projection's head shares the identifier `T`

#### Scenario: The shadow holds through a qualified-path projection dependent on the impl's own generic parameter

- **WHEN** a module declares an impl whose self type is a QUALIFIED path dependent on the impl's own generic parameter (`impl<T: HasItem> Marker<T> for <T>::Item {}`) and ALSO declares an unrelated `use <some path> as Item;` naming a real subtree-defined type
- **THEN** the system does not react — a qualified-path self type is never a placeable nominal path (its own dependent type lives outside the path's segments entirely, so no bare-segment shadow check alone can recognize it), so it is dropped before any resolution is attempted, never resolved through the alias merely because the projection's trailing segment shares the identifier `Item`

#### Scenario: A cfg_attr-wrapped-path module's derive or impl is followed, whichever candidate exists

- **WHEN** a governed module is declared only via `#[cfg_attr(any(), path = "never.rs")] pub mod domain;` with `domain.rs` (the conventional file, present) declaring `#[derive(serde::Serialize)] pub struct Order;` and `never.rs` (the target) absent, under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize`
- **THEN** the system reads `domain.rs` — the file every build actually compiles here — and reacts, never treating the `cfg_attr` attribute as a bound to skip the module outright

### Requirement: CI reaction, severity, and baseline parity

The system SHALL fold forbidden-marker findings into the same exit-code contract as the other dimensions (0 clean / 1 enforce violation / 2 constitution or scan error) and aggregate them with the other boundaries. A boundary SHALL carry a severity (`enforce` default, or `warn`, which reports without failing), and its violations SHALL be gated against the same `Baseline` (identity `(target, rule_key, fact)`, the rule a fixed string), so a project may adopt the boundary on a dirty codebase and gate only on new acquisitions.

#### Scenario: A warn boundary reports without failing

- **WHEN** a `warn`-severity forbidden-marker boundary is violated and no enforce-severity boundary is violated
- **THEN** the system reports the violation but the reaction does not fail (exit 0)

#### Scenario: A new acquisition beyond the baseline fails

- **WHEN** an enforce-severity boundary has an acquisition not present in the baseline
- **THEN** the system fails the reaction (exit 1) for that new acquisition

### Requirement: Human-readable violation report

A forbidden-marker violation report SHALL identify the governed subtree anchor, the rule (that the subtree's types must not acquire the forbidden trait), the offending acquisition and the type (the finding — `derive <T> on <Type>` or `impl <T> for <Type> in <module>`, the impl form naming the impl-site module), and the human-readable reason, and SHALL state that the reaction failed — the same report contract as the other boundaries.

#### Scenario: Report explains the acquisition

- **WHEN** `crate::domain::order` declares `#[derive(serde::Serialize)] pub struct Order;` under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize` on `crate::domain`
- **THEN** the report names the anchor `crate::domain`, the rule "must not acquire trait", the finding `derive serde::Serialize on crate::domain::order::Order` (canonical-path-keyed), the boundary's reason, and indicates CI failed

### Requirement: Forbidden-marker acquisitions are structured facts

A marker-acquisition violation SHALL encode acquisition form, marker, module, owner/type, and item
roles where observed under a structured rule key. Rendered acquisition text and scan position SHALL
NOT define identity.

#### Scenario: Different acquisitions stay distinct
- **WHEN** two forbidden acquisitions differ by form, marker, module, or owner
- **THEN** their structured facts differ in that observed role

### Requirement: A hand-impl nested in a const or fn body is observed

The system SHALL observe the hand-`impl T for X` acquisition form when the `impl` is written as a direct statement of the outermost body of a `const` initializer (a bare `{ … }` block expression) or of a `fn`'s own body — the "const-eval trick" idiom and its fn-body-nested sibling, the identical shape `semantic-trait-impl-locality` states this property for, since both capabilities read the crate-wide `impl` collection this requirement's observation is drawn from. Recovery carries the identical bounds: only an `impl` that is a DIRECT statement of the `const`/`fn`'s own outermost block is recovered — one level further in, or a `static` initializer, is NOT — stated rather than left silent.

A hand-impl nested one level further inside such a body, or wrapped in a `static` initializer, stays a stated bound (bound: semantic-signature-coupling/an-impl-nested-one-level-further-or-static-wrapped-is-a-stated-bound) — declared once by `semantic-signature-coupling`, which states this anchor-and-item property on every single-module-anchored capability's behalf, and referenced here rather than restated.

#### Scenario: A const-wrapped hand-impl reacts

- **WHEN** `crate::wire` declares `const _: () = { impl serde::Serialize for crate::domain::Order {} };` under a boundary forbidding `serde::Serialize` on `crate::domain`, and `Order` is defined under that subtree
- **THEN** the system emits a violation identifying `impl serde::Serialize for crate::domain::Order in crate::wire`, rather than reporting zero findings because the impl sits inside a const initializer

#### Scenario: A fn-body-wrapped hand-impl reacts

- **WHEN** `crate::wire` declares `fn _also() { impl serde::Serialize for crate::domain::Order {} }` under the identical boundary
- **THEN** the system emits the identical violation, rather than reporting zero findings because the impl sits inside a fn body
