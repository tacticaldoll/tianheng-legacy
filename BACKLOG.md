# Backlog

Forward-looking work, deliberately deferred. Promote an item to an ordinary `<type>/<scope>-<slug>`
branch when you pick it up. Every future reaction obeys the drift law:

> **No drift type without an observation source. No target type or name without a
> reaction.**

Nothing here is "designed" yet — reaction *phases* with their observation sources named,
not APIs. A new observation dimension is **a crate, born when it is built** (never a
pre-created empty stub); the heavy dependency it needs is quarantined to that crate so the
`guibiao` core keeps `serde_json` as its only **external** dependency.

## Backlog governance — evidence before promotion

The live backlog is a decision surface, not a promise that every recorded idea will ship. Before a
live item is promoted, it must name: **class**, **observed pressure**, **observation source**,
**current reaction or bound**, **risk**, **promotion trigger**, **version class**, and **authority**
(the spec, project decision, or code/test evidence that owns the claim). Classify it as:

- **READY-PATCH** — supported pressure with a concrete source, and the correction preserves the
  published API and current baseline/report identity wire. **It classifies the evidence and the
  compatibility, not how much design the correction still needs.** An entry whose pressure is measured and
  whose fix breaks nothing is READY-PATCH even when the fix is a capability someone has yet to design —
  reading the class as "small" or "next" is what made one such entry sit here for a window declaring no
  class at all, because neither WATCH (which is for *thin* evidence) nor DESIGN-BREAKING (which is for a
  *migration*) described it and this one looked too large.
- **DESIGN-BREAKING** — a supported problem whose honest solution needs a public or wire migration.
- **WATCH** — plausible pressure without enough adopter, second-consumer, or correctness evidence.
- **ACCEPTED DEBT** — a known, bounded risk whose current reaction or documented coverage bound is
  intentionally sufficient.
- **DECLINED** — a considered direction rejected for a recorded reason.
- **BUILT / HISTORY** — shipped context retained only where it explains a live contract or trigger;
  requirements live in [`openspec/specs/*`](openspec/specs) and settled rationale in [`PROJECT.md`](PROJECT.md).
  Detailed historical ledgers for 0.1.x – 0.3.0 are archived in [`docs/history/0.1.0-0.3.0-built-ledger.md`](docs/history/0.1.0-0.3.0-built-ledger.md).

A **closed** item leaves the live class it was filed under; it does not stay there struck through. Its
reproduction record moves to *Closed — reproduction records* below, because a class heading is read as a
queue and an entry that carries a question and its answer at once is a reader trap.

## Open defect queue

No live queue currently. The `v0.2.3..release/0.4.0` adversarial sweep that populated this section
is fully closed: every finding reached a terminal state — 11 fixed (each its own `change/*` + PR,
cited in the affected code's history and `CHANGELOG.md`), 2 verified moot, 2 refuted, 6 promoted to
live decisions below, and its own prior two-round sweep's 6 refuted / 6 upheld-by-only-one-lens
findings absorbed into `DECLINED`/`WATCH` below (condensed deliberately rather than kept verbatim,
to avoid a future reader anchoring on a raw agent-verdict's specific phrasing instead of the settled
conclusion). **A sweep's findings are entries in this file, closed or open — there is no second queue.**
The `docs/audit/*.md` convention that used to promise each sweep its own dated file is retired: a closed
finding's substance is its closing PR and `CHANGELOG.md`, an open one is a `READY-PATCH` or `WATCH` entry
below with the observation source and trigger this file already asks for, and a separate file was a second
place holding the same two things. It also regenerated a hazard every campaign — the last one carried
hand-written line counts of live functions, unheld by anything, written by the same review round that was
removing that class elsewhere.

The `v0.4.0..release/0.5.0` merged-review campaign is the first to land under this rule, and it is now fully
closed: its repairs are `CHANGELOG.md`'s `### Self-governance` section and three pull requests in the 0.5.0 window, and its
three orphaned spec requirements closed with the last of those. Its reproduction record is under *Closed —
reproduction records*; what it left standing is filed by class in the index below — the deferred structural
findings and the lifecycle-prose finding, both `WATCH`. **No live queue.**

## Live decision index

### DESIGN-BREAKING

**Empty.** Every item that stood here when the 0.4.0 window opened is closed; each one's reproduction
record is kept under *Closed — reproduction records* below, out of this queue so the index cannot read as open
migrations. Nothing currently requires a public or wire migration.

The `xuanji` sink for shared run/projection vocabulary remains *classed* DESIGN-BREAKING while sitting
under WATCH — its promotion trigger (a second standalone instrument consumer demonstrating the same
projection/run need) has not fired, and acting on it speculatively would break the proven standalone 圭表
consumer for an undemonstrated deduplication.

### ACCEPTED DEBT

- **The bounds-method reader anchors on a whole-line occurrence that is not the definition.** *Class:*
  ACCEPTED DEBT — **reclassified from READY-PATCH, which claimed a patch this entry's own Shape refutes.** All
  three closures it names are refused there: literal adjacency to `impl Observer for` was measured against the
  three real files and would refuse the real definitions; scope containment survives that and still admits a
  perturbation wrapping the whole fake `impl` block; and reading what the compiler resolves needs Rust parsing
  `kanhe`'s declared allowlist forbids. The remaining closure — a **shared** nested-span lexer serving this
  reader and `region.rs`'s identical residue — exists as `guibiao::module_scan`, and `kanhe` may not depend on
  圭表. Debt accepted with a declared bound and a named instrument it cannot reach is what ACCEPTED DEBT is
  for; READY-PATCH said *someone may patch this now*. *Observed pressure:* the reader requires the signature to occur exactly once and at a line
  start, and knows nothing of comments or literals. So where the definition has moved out of the inspected
  file, any surviving **whole-line** copy anchors — reproduced with a block-comment copy, and again with a
  copy inside a `&str` constant, both giving
  `every_observer_declares_exactly_its_dimension_s_bounds ... ok`. *Observation source:* those two
  perturbations, run during the closing review of the 0.5.0 window.
  *Current reaction or bound:* the declared bound
  `observer-protocol/a-whole-line-occurrence-that-is-not-the-definition-anchors-the-read-a-stated-bound`.
  *Risk, measured rather than assumed:* **narrower than it first reads.** A *divergent* second list does not
  pass — `observation-bound-model` reads every dimension through `Observer::bounds` and holds a bijection with
  the specs, so a difference in membership or content fails `the_extent_projection_is_fresh` and the
  classification test one capability over. What passes is a second, hand-maintained path that **agrees today**
  and is maintained by hand from now on: re-run with a list rebuilt element by element from
  `observation_bounds()`, the whole workspace suite is green. *Promotion trigger:* fired; both perturbations
  are tree artefacts rather than reports. *Version class:* patch; a `tests/` reaction of this repository,
  shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `observer-protocol`.

  *Shape, with the corpus measured rather than borrowed:* comment stripping does **not** close this — a string
  literal is not a comment — so the register's rejection of comment-delimiter lexing is not the reason here,
  and citing it was wrong. This reader's corpus is the three files `DIMENSIONS` names, none of which carries a
  string literal with a comment delimiter, so the register's measurement does not transfer in
  either direction. Two candidate closures, **neither adopted, and neither actually closes the class** —
  checked against the real corpus rather than left as an abstract choice. Requiring the anchor to be preceded
  by an `impl Observer for` line was measured against the three real files and refuted as stated: every real
  `fn bounds(&self)` sits several lines and one sibling method below its `impl Observer for` line (a doc
  comment and `fn observe` come between them), so a literal adjacency rule would refuse the real definitions
  too. A looser scope-containment version (nested inside *some* `impl Observer for … { … }` block, not
  necessarily adjacent) survives that check, but only raises the bar rather than closing the class: a
  perturbation that wraps the *whole* fake `impl Observer for` block — not just the `fn bounds` line — inside
  the same comment or string would still be accepted, because a scope tracker blind to comments and literals
  reads a fake `impl` line inside a comment exactly as it reads a real one. The other candidate — reading the
  definition the compiler resolves rather than a textual condition — needs real Rust parsing, which `kanhe`'s
  declared dependency allowlist (`AGENTS.self-law.md`) currently forbids; adopting it would first require
  amending that law, not just this reader.

  **Not a defect unique to this reader.** `crates/kanhe/src/region.rs`'s own `Executed` abstraction declares
  the identical residue for the same reason (a `/\* … \*/` span and a string-literal marker both need
  nested-span lexing this tree has "defeated repeatedly," in that module's own words) and cites this exact
  bound as its precedent — the citation was one-directional until the 0.5.0 window closed it: see the
  `observer-protocol` spec, now amended to cite `region.rs` back. Filing them separately let each be
  rediscovered as a fresh problem; they are one class. If this is ever closed, the closure is a **shared**
  nested-span lexer serving both sites, not a point patch to either — `guibiao::module_scan` already scans
  nested block comments and is the instrument `region.rs`'s own doc comment names as existing if the residue
  is ever worth closing.

- **A hand-maintained pin has no mechanism keeping it from rotting — the action SHAs, and now the Node
  version.** *Class:* ACCEPTED DEBT.
  *Observed pressure:* pinning `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `uses:` entries to commits closed the one
  ecosystem this repository resolved fresh on every run, and opened its dual — a SHA nobody refreshes drifts
  from the upstream fix it was pinned before. `node-version` joined them for the same reason and at the same
  cost: `'24'` resolved whatever 24.x the runner's mirror carried that day, so the interpreter executing the
  digest-pinned validator tree was itself repointable while the step beside it was named *pinned*. It reads
  `'24.16.0'` now, and inherits this entry rather than a promise that someone will notice. *Observation source:* the `v0.4.0..HEAD` static review, which
  found every action on a mutable major tag while `Cargo.lock` and `package-lock.json` pinned their own
  ecosystems by digest; the refresh gap is this repair's own consequence rather than a second finding.
  *Current reaction or bound:* none, and that is the entry. Nothing here reads the workflow, and no
  Dependabot or Renovate configuration exists in this repository. *Risk, bounded rather than assumed:* every
  `uses:` in the workflow runs under `permissions: contents: read` against a repository whose CI holds no
  secret beyond that grant — **stated as the criterion because the list was typed and went stale.** It read
  *the actions are `actions/checkout` and `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action`*, two, while the workflow pins
  **three**: `actions/setup-node` arrived with the Node interpreter pin this entry itself narrates, and the
  enumeration the disposition reasons from did not move with it. Measured 2026-09-06 by reading the `uses:`
  lines. What bounds the risk is the permission grant, which is a property of the workflow rather than of
  which actions it happens to name, so the criterion holds whatever the count becomes. A stale
  checkout is a stale checkout; the failure it invites is missing an upstream fix, not executing something
  unchosen — which is the direction the pin closed.

  ***Promotion trigger, and it FIRED.*** As written, this entry promoted on *a pinned action falling far
  enough behind to miss a security advisory, or **a second ecosystem arriving whose pinning would want the
  same answer***. The Node interpreter pin is that second ecosystem, and it was added to this entry — the
  trigger fired in the same commit that extended the entry naming it, and nobody read it. Recorded here
  rather than repaired by rewording, because a trigger quietly widened after it fires is a trigger that
  never fires.

  *Disposition, 2026-08-24:* **the half with teeth was built, and no refresh bot was adopted.** The rot
  splits in two and only one half was open. Falling *behind within* a major is bounded — `engines.node` at
  `">=24 <25"` with `.npmrc`'s `engine-strict=true` — and the residue is a patch-level lag on a tree resolved
  by digest and run under `--ignore-scripts`. Running the interpreter *past the point its major is
  maintained* had nothing reacting to it at all, and `interpreter_support_window` now does: the pin declares
  the window it is good for, and the reaction refuses when that window is absent, doubled, unreadable,
  declared for a major the workflow no longer pins, or reached.

  *And the evaluation below was of the wrong tool for half of this entry.* Dependabot's `github-actions`
  ecosystem updates the action versions a workflow `uses:` — **not the inputs those actions take**, so
  `node-version:` is outside it. Adopting Dependabot would have closed the action-SHA half and left the Node
  half exactly where it was, which is not what the paragraph below assumes. Renovate reaches both, through
  its custom managers and a Node datasource. That does not change the decision, and it does change what the
  decision is *about*: the cost named below — a bot-authored pull-request stream entering a merge path whose
  wrapper judges every squash message against its pull request — is unchanged, and is now the whole of it,
  since the half a bot would uniquely buy is the one just closed by a reaction that needs no bot, no second
  author, and no network.

  *Promotion trigger, restated so it can fire again:* a pinned action falling far enough behind to miss a
  security advisory; a **third** hand-maintained pin arriving, since two were answerable one at a time and
  three is a mechanism; or the declared support window being reached with no maintained major to move to.
  Node's half of this debt is bounded differently from the actions': `package.json` declares
  `"node": ">=24 <25"` and `.npmrc` sets `engine-strict=true`, so a runner or a contributor arriving on
  another major **stops** rather than proceeding on different bytes — measured on npm 11.13.0, where an
  unsatisfiable `engines` warns and exits 0 without it and exits 1 naming both sides with it. The pin can
  therefore fall behind within its major, and cannot silently leave it.

  *Compatibility class:* patch; CI configuration ships in no crate. *Authority:* this entry, and the workflow
  comment's refresh recipe — `repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<tag>`, which dereferences an annotated tag to its
  commit where `git/ref/tags` returns the tag object.

  A refresh bot — Dependabot for the actions, Renovate for both — was considered and not adopted **now**, for
  a reason rather than by omission: it would add a configuration file, a bot-authored pull-request stream,
  and a second squash-message author to a repository whose merge path is a wrapper that judges every squash
  message against its pull request. That interaction is real work and belongs to a change of its own, not to
  the pin that created the need.

- **A check that never wrote a region decision is invisible.** *Class:* ACCEPTED DEBT. *Observed pressure:* the
  region classifier exists because six defects were one shape, and two more were found afterwards in a check
  that never adopted it. Those two were *wrong* decisions and a reaction can see a wrong decision; a check that
  simply never distinguished executed text from commentary has written nothing to see. *Observation source:*
  none, which is the entry. *Current reaction or bound:* declared as
  `repository-checks/a-check-that-should-distinguish-a-region-and-does-not-a-stated-bound`; the requirement
  obliges the classifier and the classifier's adoption is what narrows the class. *Risk:* **corrected below —
  the sentence that stood here was falsified by the first instance.** *Promotion trigger:* a defect of this
  class observed in the wild — a check reported clean over text its property did not cover. Note that a
  candidate was reported during the `0.5.0` review and **refuted by measurement**, so the trigger asks for a
  confirmed one. *Compatibility class:* patch; the checks ship in zero packages. *Authority:*
  `openspec/specs/repository-checks/spec.md`'s requirement on the region a check judges.

  The mechanization was designed and rejected rather than deferred: refusing the inline comment marker inside
  the checks would refuse more legitimate sites than defects, because some select commentary on purpose and
  others parse a data format whose syntax marks comments. That measurement is the reason this is debt rather
  than a gap someone forgot.

  **First instance, and it cost something.** A static review of the `v0.4.0..HEAD` window found
  `kanhe::manifest::workspace_version` reading raw lines — the one manifest reader both git-reading gates
  share, and the last one in the crate that had not adopted the classifier. Its sibling `package_name` had
  been repaired the same way already, so one root `Cargo.toml` was being scanned under two different region
  decisions inside a single judgement, which this requirement calls a defect by definition. Found by a
  reviewer, as the entry predicts: the absence had written nothing for a reaction to see.

  *What the instance changes:* the risk sentence, which said a check in this class **reads a wider corpus than
  its property, so it errs toward reporting more**. That was wrong in both directions at once here.
  `[workspace.package] # …` made the reader close the table before it opened, so the version read as
  **absent** — a narrower corpus, not a wider one — and `version = "X.Y.Z" # …` carried the comment into the
  value, so the version read as **malformed**. Both are legal TOML and both produced a false *refusal*, in
  front of `cargo publish` and the release gate, on the manifest line an author is most likely to annotate
  while bumping. So the direction is not "errs toward reporting more"; it is *whichever way the missing
  decision happens to fall*, and a false refusal at an irreversible act is not the cheap error the old
  sentence assumed.

  *What it does not change:* the class, and the stated trigger. The trigger asks for a check that reported
  **clean** over text its property did not cover, and this reported the opposite, so it is an instance of the
  class without being the promotion evidence the entry asks for. The mechanization measurement has not moved
  either — refusing the inline marker would still refuse more legitimate sites than defects — so this stays
  ACCEPTED DEBT rather than becoming a gap with a design. Whether a falsified risk sentence alone should
  re-open the class is a steward's call, recorded here rather than taken.

- **`examples/observer-participant`'s own test fixture was not migrated to `xingbiao::claim_scratch`,
  unlike every other scratch-root claim in the workspace.** *Class:* ACCEPTED DEBT. *Observed pressure:*
  an adversarial review of the whole `v0.4.0..HEAD` campaign found `examples/observer-participant/tests/
  reaction.rs`'s `Fixture::new` still does `remove_dir_all` then `create_dir_all(root.join("src"))` on a
  predictable `temp_dir().join(format!("house-rules-{name}-{pid}"))` path — the exact symlink-adoption
  race the `claim_scratch` migration closed at every other one of the ~40 call sites it touched.
  *Observation source:* read directly; confirmed every other workspace fixture with this shape now calls
  `claim_scratch` and this one does not. *Current reaction or bound:* none. *Risk:* low and unchanged from
  before the migration — developer-machine-only, requires a local attacker able to plant a symlink at a
  PID-guessable path before this one test runs, in an example crate that ships in no package. *Why debt,
  not a gap someone forgot:* `examples/observer-participant/Cargo.toml` states its design goal explicitly —
  "One dependency, and deliberately nothing else... an example that needed a new export would be proving
  the opposite of what it exists to prove" — and `claim_scratch` is not re-exported through `tianheng`'s
  public prelude. Migrating this fixture would require either adding a new export to `tianheng` just for
  an example's own test helper, or adding `xingbiao` as a second dependency, either of which contradicts
  the example's stated purpose. *Promotion trigger:* `xingbiao::claim_scratch` (or an equivalent) becoming
  reachable through `tianheng::prelude` for an unrelated reason — **not fired, measured 2026-09-06: the
  wildcard prelude re-exports no scratch-directory helper, so the fixture still could not reach one** — at
  which point migrating this one fixture
  would cost nothing further. *Version class:* patch; an example, shipping in no package. *Authority:*
  `examples/observer-participant/Cargo.toml`'s own header comment, the one place this constraint is
  declared.

- **The shell's semantic delegation, held by construction.** **Still open**, and one attempt at it is recorded
  here because the attempt's own reasoning was wrong. The shell's semantic arm now invokes `SemanticObserver`
  rather than calling 渾儀's composed entry point beside it, which was this entry's named shape — and review
  measured that it closes nothing here: writing the bound's exact WHEN into the arm, a guard deciding
  emptiness itself before delegating, leaves the whole suite and every gate green. What it *did* close is the
  two paths' **equality** for this dimension, which is a different property and is now construction-held. The
  runtime precedent does not transfer: that arm held a second implementation of the corpus derivation, the
  audit call and the `cannot read workspace` message, and delegating collapsed its two copies into one, whereas
  the semantic arm always had one implementation with two callers. Closing this one needs the shell's semantic
  outcome to be *unreachable* except through the observer — a shape where the guard stops compiling — which is
  a design step, not a call-site swap. *Class:* ACCEPTED DEBT — **reclassified from READY-PATCH on 2026-09-03, when every route to its own
  Shape was measured closed.** The choice was made on a stated principle rather than on taste: an entry
  nobody can act on charges every future reader who reads it as actionable, and closing that costs
  nothing, where the one remaining route costs an adopter accessor. The bound below is untouched and
  still fires; what changed is the claim that someone may patch this. *Observed pressure:* the
  source-shape reaction that claimed to observe it is retired in the 0.5.0 window after four review rounds each
  defeated the narrowing before it — by name resolution, by the parameter's binding site, by which definition is
  the subject, by the caller frame, and by execution, which no reading of text reaches. `observer-protocol`
  declares the resulting gap as an unpinned bound owned by the engine, and it is the tracker for this entry.
  *Observation source:* that bound and the retired reaction's history on `change/refuse-ambiguous-delegation-extent`.
  *Current reaction or bound:* the declared bound; no reaction. *Risk:* the shell grows a second semantic
  behaviour owner and nothing says so — the drift a seam exists to end. The dimension's *equality* is
  construction-held since the 0.5.0 window; its *delegation* is the seam that is not, and the two are one word
  apart. *Promotion trigger:* fired; the bound is declared unpinned, which the register leads with.
  *Version class:* patch if the composition is restructured without moving a public signature; minor if the
  shell's entry point changes shape. *Authority:* `observer-protocol`, whose spec states both the obligation and
  the retirement. *Shape:* **not** the runtime route, which the 0.5.0 window
  tried and measured wrong: invoking the observer makes the *equality* construction-held and leaves an
  independent shell decision as writable as before, because the runtime arm had a second implementation to
  collapse and this one never did. What would close it is the shell's semantic outcome being unreachable except
  through the observer — a shape in which the guard stops compiling rather than one in which it merely has
  nowhere tidy to sit.

  **Premises re-measured 2026-09-03, and every one holds.** The semantic arm invokes
  `SemanticObserver::new(...).observe(...)`; the declared gap is
  `observer-protocol/whether-the-shell-makes-an-independent-semantic-decision-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`,
  unpinned and engine-owned; and the runtime contrast is stated where it can be checked rather than only
  here — that arm's own comment records the second copy delegation collapsed, and this arm's records that it
  never had one. **The failed attempt's measurement is carried in the code itself**, in the arm's comment: *a
  guard deciding emptiness above this line still compiles and passes every gate*. Nothing has drifted, and
  the shape is unchanged: a design step, not a call-site swap.

  Worth noting beside the entry above about a shape's unrecorded status: of the entries taken to the tree,
  this is the one that wrote down its own failed attempt, and it is the one whose premises survived
  re-measurement intact. The record is what kept them about what was measured rather than about what was
  assumed.

  **The Shape's price was measured on 2026-09-03 and it is not a refactor.** *Unreachable except through the
  observer* means the shell cannot see the semantic bundle, and the shell is where `Constitution` is defined —
  so nothing about the layering prevents a guard; what would prevent one is
  `Constitution::semantic_boundaries()` no longer being callable. That accessor is **documented adopter
  surface**: `COOKBOOK.md` hands a reader `check_all(constitution().semantic_boundaries(), &manifest())` as
  the way to unit-test the semantic teeth, `crates/tianheng/tests/adopter_surface.rs` exercises it twice
  including in the `Run` composition the protocol exists to offer, and `examples/sans-io-pure` reads through
  it. So the design step is an adopter-facing removal that would take the composition path this capability
  exists to provide, not a restructuring inside the shell.

  **The other two routes were already closed in the tree, and reading them first is why no code was written
  here.** The source-shape reaction was built, defeated four times and retired
  (`refactor(tianheng): retire the composition-body reaction, declare the gap`). And folding the shell's two
  `if !matches!` arms into `Run` removes no duplication: `crates/kanhe/tests/observer_protocol.rs`'s own
  header records that two composition paths exist for the **static** dimension alone — coverage needs
  `check_and_cover` and a second call would read `cargo metadata` twice — while *for the semantic and runtime
  dimensions there is no second path left to compare*. `Run` offers no seed by which the already-computed
  static outcome could enter it, and a seed adapter is refused by
  `every_observer_declares_exactly_its_dimension_s_bounds`, since it would claim a dimension's bounds a
  second time.

  So all three routes are closed and none of the closures is a defect. Whether this stays a class someone may
  pick up, or becomes accepted debt beside its permanent bound, is a steward's decision rather than a patch —
  it turns on whether the adopter accessor is worth the delegation, and nothing in the tree decides that.

  *Reopening:* the accessor's price changing — `Constitution::semantic_boundaries()` leaving the documented
  adopter surface for a reason of its own, at which point the compile-time shape stops costing the
  composition path this capability offers. Not *someone finds time*: the three routes are closed by
  properties of the tree, and only one of those properties can move.

- **The `**BREAKING**` marking rule is paired per section, so an unmarked breaking entry beside a marked
  one is invisible.** *Class:* ACCEPTED DEBT — **reclassified from READY-PATCH on 2026-09-03, when the one surviving candidate
  was priced.** *Observed pressure:* `require_section_shape` collects
  `shape.breaking` as a set of **section names**, and requires each such section to carry a `### Migration`
  heading. One marked entry plus one Migration heading therefore satisfies the whole section however many
  unmarked breaking entries sit beside them. Measured on this repository's own `[0.5.0]`: its `### Migration`
  section instructed an adopter to change every `Outcome::Clean` pattern, while the entry that change belongs
  to carried no mark. The gate was green throughout, before and after the correction. *Observation source:* the `v0.4.0..HEAD`
  static review, and the correction it produced. *Current reaction or bound:* `release-coherence`'s
  section-shape requirement, which is what this entry says is too coarse; nothing else reads the marking.
  *Risk, bounded rather than assumed:* the information is **present but unannounced** — a reader who opens
  `### Migration` finds the instruction either way, so the failure is an adopter skimming `### Changed` for
  what affects them and not seeing the mark that exists to be skimmed for. It cannot make a released
  guarantee false. *Promotion trigger:* a second unmarked breaking entry, or an adopter reporting a missed
  migration. The first instance is recorded rather than promoted on, because the shape below is not yet
  decided. *Version class:* patch; a repository check shipping in no crate. *Authority:*
  `openspec/specs/release-coherence/spec.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`'s own marking rule.

  *A collision the shape has to answer, found while dispositioning this queue.* The named join would backfill
  a handle into every existing Migration bullet — and `[0.5.0]`'s bullets sit in a **dated, released**
  section. Rewriting one to satisfy a rule written afterwards is what this repository refuses as a stated
  bound, the same reasoning that leaves `docs/history/` alone. So the join holds over sections still being
  written and released sections keep the shape they were released with; the instance that produced this entry
  stays unmarked, as a record rather than as debt. That is part of the design and not a detail after it.

  *Shape.* The direction that actually matters — *an entry that should be marked and is not* — is undecidable
  by any reaction, because it asks whether a change requires adopter action. The candidates below work around
  that, and they separate on whether the rule is a **theorem** — so it can be a violation without inviting a
  false refusal — and whether it catches **the instance that produced this entry**.

  - **A migration section in a release section that marks nothing `**BREAKING**`.** A theorem — telling an
    adopter to act while declaring nothing breaking contradicts `CHANGELOG.md`'s own rule — and nearly free.
    It does **not** catch the observed instance: `[0.5.0]` carried one marked entry, and what went missing
    was the *second*. A check that cannot cover the case it was written from reads as coverage while
    providing none, and this one has zero observations of its own besides, so it is named here to be
    rejected rather than kept as a cheap option.
  - **The counting asymmetry** — a section whose Migration bullets outnumber its marked entries. Pure
    counting, no semantics, and it would have caught this instance. It is **not** a theorem: one breaking
    change may legitimately need two migration steps. So it cannot be a violation without the false refusal
    this repository forbids its gates, and `refusal::Kind` is not the place to put it — *cannot-judge* means
    the source could not be read, not that it was read and is ambiguous, and borrowing it here would blunt
    the one distinction the verdict channel exists to carry.
  - **A named join, which is a theorem and does catch it.** Require each Migration bullet to name the entry
    it migrates by a stable handle, and run the correspondence both ways. This is the shape
    `observation_bound_model.rs` already uses between a spec scenario and its typed declaration, and it
    turns detection into **declaration**, which is where this family puts enforcement: the obligation lands
    on the author, not on a reader of prose. Two bullets may share a handle and one bullet may carry two, so
    neither multiplicity is a false refusal. The cost is real and is an authoring-convention change: every
    future Migration bullet gains a handle, and `[0.5.0]`'s existing bullets would be backfilled.

    A Migration section may also carry a bullet that deliberately names **no** entry — `[0.5.0]`'s
    *Nothing else requires action* is one — so the join has to admit a declared-empty form, or such a bullet
    moves out of the section. Which of the two is part of the design rather than a detail after it, and it
    was invisible while this paragraph carried a hand-typed count that happened to omit that bullet.

  **An earlier wording of this paragraph refuted the join outright**, on the ground that pairing an entry to a
  Migration bullet needs text matching between two prose bullets. That is true only of the *implicit* form.
  Making the handle explicit is precisely how this repository escapes prose matching everywhere else, and
  refuting the whole candidate for the weakness of its weakest form would have told whoever picks this up
  that the road was closed.

  *Leaving the changelog entirely* — reading the **published surface** and requiring a mark wherever it
  changed incompatibly — remains the most direct instrument and carries a cost this entry first omitted:
  both `cargo public-api` and a raw rustdoc-JSON diff need **nightly**, while this workspace pins a stable
  MSRV and CI installs no nightly toolchain. Adding one is its own decision, not a step inside this repair.

  All of which is why the entry is filed at its measured size rather than repaired inside the release window
  that found it: the only candidate that is both a theorem and covers its own instance is a capability, not a
  tightening.

  **The premises were measured against the tree on 2026-09-03, before any of this was costed, and two of them
  do not hold.** The first does: `section_shape` collects `breaking` as a set of **section names**, so one
  occurrence plus one `### Migration` heading satisfies the whole section, however many unmarked entries sit
  beside them.

  - **The first candidate is said to have *zero observations of its own*. It has one.** `[0.3.0]` carries a
    `### Migration` heading and **no** `**BREAKING**` occurrence at all — a released, dated section that
    predates the marking rule this file records the reason for. So *a migration section that marks nothing*
    is not a shape with no instance; it is a shape whose one instance sits in history, needing exactly the
    released-section exemption the named join needs. The candidate stays rejected and the reason changes.
  - **The second candidate's count is not defined yet, and which way it falls depends on that.** *Migration
    bullets outnumber marked entries* is said to have caught the observed instance. Measured on `[0.5.0]`,
    whose content is frozen: by the rule the existing reader uses — a line **containing** the marker — ten of
    its entries are marked against three bullets, and the asymmetry does **not** fire. By a marker recognised
    at an entry's **opening**, two are marked against three bullets, and it does. The candidate is a
    counting rule over a population the entry never says how to recognise, which is this repository's own
    recorded lesson about a text reaction reading its own text, arriving where the count is the whole
    argument.
  - **The reader's subject is wider than the marks, and that reach is declared, deliberate and pinned.**
    `section_shape` arms `breaking` on any line containing the marker, so prose about the marking rule arms
    it: eight of `[0.5.0]`'s ten are entries that discuss the rule rather than carry it, and a section
    discussing the rule while migrating nothing is refused. **This was written down as new when it was
    already recorded in three places, and the correction matters more than the observation.**
    `release-coherence/prose-about-the-marker-is-read-as-a-marker-a-stated-bound` declares it as an engine-owned
    over-reaction, `prose_about_the_marker_is_read_as_a_marker_a_stated_bound` pins it against a body that
    announces nothing and is refused anyway, and `CHANGELOG.md` states the decision with its reason. That
    reason is the one that governs the candidate above: **recognising the marker at an entry's start was
    considered and declined**, because a positional matcher buys a false negative in the floor — a real break
    whose marker sits anywhere but the first token would stop being observed — and the Core Contract forbids
    exactly one bug, which is that one.

    So the second candidate's population is not merely undefined; **defining it the way that makes it fire
    would reverse a declared bound.** Counting by containment, the asymmetry does not fire on the instance it
    is said to catch. Counting by position, it fires and the floor moves. Whoever picks this entry up inherits
    that choice already made against them, which is a narrower option space than *a counting rule needing a
    definition*.

  The third candidate's stated need survives: `[0.5.0]`'s third Migration bullet is *Nothing else requires
  action*, so a join does have to admit a declared-empty form.

  **Decided: the named join is not built, and the price is the reason.** It is the only candidate that is both
  a theorem and covers its own instance, so the choice is not between candidates — it is between paying for
  that one and accepting the gap. The price is a **permanent authoring tax**: every future Migration bullet
  gains a handle, at every release, forever. What it buys is that a breaking entry cannot go unannounced
  while its migration step is present — and *present* is the operative word, because the information a
  reader needs is in the `### Migration` section either way. The failure this closes is an adopter skimming
  `### Changed` and not seeing a mark that exists; it cannot make a released guarantee false, which this
  entry's own risk clause already says.

  Permanent cost against a bounded, visible failure is the trade this repository declines elsewhere — the
  release-date entry above declines a check for being right at one moment and wrong the rest of the time,
  and the branch-naming entry declines a gate whose whole consequence is legibility. This is that shape a
  third time, and taking it consistently is what keeps the governance share falling.

  *Reopening — both halves kept, and one added rather than substituted:* a second unmarked breaking entry,
  or an adopter reporting a missed migration, **or a `### Migration` section found to omit a step a breaking
  change actually needed** — the last being the case where the information is absent rather than merely
  unannounced, which is the failure the price would be worth paying for.

### READY-PATCH

- **A version this repository never released is written into tracked prose, and nothing resolves it.**
  *Class:* READY-PATCH — the pressure is measured and the correction touches no published surface. *Observed
  pressure:* release class is decided from what a window's changes **do**, so a window's number is not
  knowable until its cut; a number written into prose beforehand becomes a pointer to nothing the moment the
  class moves. **It has moved three times.** Measured 2026-09-06 over every `X.Y.Z` literal in tracked live
  Markdown outside `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/history/`: three distinct numbers appear with neither a dated
  changelog section nor a tag, and the trend runs the wrong way — 15 occurrences, then 4, then 30. The
  numbers themselves are not written here, for the reason the repair below gives. *Observation source:* the
  promotion-trigger sweep, which reached it sideways: a release branch's rename had been carried into a
  measurement addressed at that branch **by name**, and GitHub does not retarget a **merged** pull request's
  base, so the figure came to name a set not containing its own evidence. That is the sharp end of the
  class; the other 23 sites merely resolved to nothing.

  *Current reaction or bound:* prose only — `AGENTS.md`'s carrier taxonomy carries the
  row, and the 24 live occurrences are repaired to name the version each window shipped as. Nothing reacts.
  *Risk:* the class is **structural rather than accidental**, which is what makes prose alone the weaker
  half: reclassifying upward is this repository's SemVer honesty working correctly, so windows will keep
  being renumbered and every window's prose will keep being written before its number is earned.

  *Promotion trigger:* fired at filing, by its own measurement — three instances, and the third produced a
  false figure rather than only a dead pointer. *Version class:* patch; no crate is touched. *Authority:*
  `repository-checks`, and `AGENTS.md`'s carrier taxonomy row.

  **Shape, and it is decidable — which is unusual for this file's prose classes.** A version literal in
  tracked live Markdown that is **below the workspace version** and has neither a `## [X.Y.Z]` dated section
  nor a `vX.Y.Z` tag names a version that never existed and never will. No judgement over meaning is needed:
  a number above the workspace version is a plan, a number with a section or a tag is a release, and what is
  left is neither. **The number survives nowhere, and that is a change from how this entry first proposed to
  close it.** The first plan kept it alive in three declaring places — this entry, `AGENTS.md`'s taxonomy
  row, and the changelog entry recording the repair — on the reasoning that a declaring site is exempt the
  way the relative-phrase bound exempts `AGENTS.md`'s own row. The steward rejected that on 潛移: what sits
  in an agent's context is what gets imitated, and a dead number qualified by a clause explaining that it is
  dead is still that number in the context, with the clause read by a human and skipped by the
  continuation. The class is decidable without an instance — the shape above states it in full — so no
  exemption is needed and none is declared. A check would therefore have **no allowlist**, which is the
  cheaper design as well as the honest one.

  Its negative run is this file's own state before the repair: the check must report the 24 sites, and the
  measurement it would have reported alongside them is gone rather than exempted — **which is the part worth
  keeping.** That figure was defended as an observation, on the ground that a query's argument is part of what
  it measured. It is; the observation was simply the wrong one. Re-addressed from the branch name to
  the window's own commit range, the same question answers **103 pull requests and three offences** where the
  branch-addressed corpus answered 22 and one. A dead name is not only unresolvable — this one was holding a
  figure three times too small, and preserving it as an observation would have preserved that.

  **What is left is choosing whether the declaring exemption is worded as a section, a file, or a marker**,
  which is a check's design and not more evidence.

- **Most pinning citations have never been seen to fail.** *Class:* READY-PATCH. *Observed pressure:* the
  register decides a citation names a test that RUNS and cannot decide that it BITES; gutting a cited pin's body
  in a worktree left the suite green and the register clean. `crates/kanhe/tests/pin_bites.rs` closes that for the citations
  that declare a mutation, and it prints how many do not on every clean run — the figure is produced there, not
  typed here. *Observation source:* that gutting, and the anchor-counting rule in `observer_protocol.rs` losing
  its only assertions during the composition-body retirement, found by a reviewer reading the diff.
  *Current reaction or bound:* `crates/kanhe/tests/pin_bites.rs` over the declared mutations; nothing over the rest.
  *Risk:* a defence that has stopped defending is indistinguishable from one that has not, which is the failure
  the register was built to end one level down. *Promotion trigger:* fired — the gate exists; what remains is
  coverage. **Decided 2026-09-03: coverage grows as an obligation on citing, not as a campaign.** Grinding the
  standing set was costed and declined on its rate — `pin_bites` reports the uncovered part on every clean
  run, and the citation set grows faster than mutations can be authored, so chasing the numerator loses to
  stopping the denominator. `AGENTS.md` now requires a citation to arrive with its mutation or with the reason
  it has none, in the same change. The debt this entry already carries from the `0.6.0` window is answered
  collectively rather than per-citation, above: six requirements gained citations, none declared a mutation,
  and the reason is recorded where the economics are. What remains is
  coverage, which grows one considered record at a time. That last claim was false while the tree under test
  was an export of tracked content: a pin reading the repository through git failed its own control run, so no
  record could ever exercise it — `units_outside_the_gate_pairing_are_outside_the_surface` was one. The tree is
  a detached worktree now and the claim holds. One citation is still outside it for a different reason:
  `a_cfg_gated_module_with_no_file_is_skipped_not_errored` is defined in two files under `crates/`, so the
  target to run it in cannot be derived from a set and any record naming it refuses. Both episodes are kept
  because the entry's economics rest on the claim. **This entry's residue grew by the citations added on 2026-09-02, and the growth is recorded here rather
  than left in the change that caused it.** Six requirements in `repository-checks` gained citations, and
  **none of them declares a mutation**, so every one landed in the part of the citation set this check
  reports as uncovered on each clean run. The figure is produced there and not typed here; what is written
  down is the direction it moved and why — a citation is cheap to add and its mutation is not, so any work
  that cites more pins enlarges this entry unless it authors the mutations too. That is the economics this
  entry rests on, observed on itself.

  *What closing it costs, measured while seeding:* a
  mutation must genuinely perturb the pinned point, and authoring one is per-bound expert work. One attempt
  during this change did not — masking a brace inside a block comment left the exact one-statement comparison
  refusing the body anyway, so the pin held and the record reported a biting pin as a dead one. That direction
  is safe, and it is why coverage cannot be swept. (Two further failures that looked the same were gate defects,
  not authoring cost: a lib test registering under its module path, and the cargo target derived from the
  mutated file rather than from the test's definition. Both are fixed and neither recurs.) *Version class:* not release-affecting; a
  repository gate over this repository's own governance tests. *Authority:* `observation-bound-register`, whose
  added requirement states the obligation and the arrangements that make it observable.

- **Every normative SHALL either has a reaction or is a declared bound.** *Class:* READY-PATCH — by the
  definition above, which classifies evidence and compatibility rather than remaining design effort: the
  pressure is measured and the correction preserves every published API. It declared no class at all until
  the classification reaction was built, because it reads as too large for a heading that sounds like "next".
  *Observed pressure:* **ten** found
  and closed through the third re-review of the 0.5.0 window. The first seven were the family's declarations staying
  literal, the equality fixture reacting in every dimension, an observer declaring exactly its dimension's bounds
  (a comparison that was `f() == f()`), the protocol's required `bounds` method having no consumer at all, *an
  audit finding carries no repair polarity*, *an observer's bounds method cannot be found where the reaction
  looks*, and *joining a run would require no new export*. The third re-review added three more: a requirement prescribed
  wording for the projected shell reason that no reaction observed, a reason-only correction claimed verdict
  stability through an impossible-to-fail scenario, and the shell's semantic delegation scenario could not detect a
  duplicated local guard. Every one was found by hand. *Observation source:* the window's closing review, rounds
  1–7 and the third re-review; the first seven are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` with the perturbation that
  proved them.

  **Promoted from WATCH because its own trigger fired, six times.** That trigger was *a normative SHALL found
  un-reacted **after** the 0.5.0 window's sweep* — the sweep being the control, so the four found before it could not
  stand as evidence for themselves. Rounds 6 and 7 then found three more, and **all three were requirements this
  window had just written**: a SHALL added in one change and left unreacted, in the window whose whole subject was
  closing that class. That is stronger evidence than the original four, because it shows the class reproducing under
  authors actively watching for it. The third re-review then found the fourth through sixth post-sweep recurrences, again
  in requirements or scenarios written in the same window; two were removed as inert, and semantic delegation
  gained a source-shape reaction.

  *Current reaction or bound:* none. Only a **bound** carries a `PINNED-BY`; an ordinary requirement is bound to
  nothing, so no gate can tell a SHALL with a reaction from one without. *Risk:* the class recurring and being found
  by hand or not at all — a normative rule nothing enforces is indistinguishable from one that is enforced, which is
  the failure the bound register was built to end one level down. *Measured before promotion, not estimated,
  and the commands rather than the figures are what is written down here:* `git grep` for `SHALL` over
  `openspec/specs/*/spec.md` answers with an order of magnitude more normative lines than the register holds
  bounds, and the register's own size is **printed by `bound_register` on every clean run** rather than
  restated in prose — the reaction is the place a reader gets it, and a figure copied here would be a second
  copy that can disagree. That gap is the argument: a citation per SHALL would add hand-maintained pointers on
  the order of the SHALL count itself, which is the drift class this family already refuses.

  *The binding is written in many places, and this entry said it was written nowhere.* Re-measurable in one
  step: `grep -c '^- \*\*PINNED-BY\*\*'` over `openspec/specs/*/spec.md`, resolved per name against every `fn`
  definition under `crates/` and `examples/`. What the measurement established is not a magnitude but two
  properties — the citations exist across a substantial minority of requirements, and **every one names a test
  that exists**. They are not unheld either: `crates/kanhe/tests/bound_register.rs` resolves each through
  `cargo test -p <member> -- --list`, per package, and refuses an empty member enumeration as the vacuity
  direction; `pin_bites` runs a declared subset against a perturbed tree, requires each to fail, and prints
  the size of that subset itself. The one ambiguous name carries a crate prefix
  (`hunyi::a_cfg_gated_module_with_no_file_is_skipped_not_errored`) because it is defined in two crates, so the
  convention already handles the case a bare citation could not.

  *First step, in two parts, and the order is what the measurement changes.* **One:** extend the existing
  citation to the requirements whose reaction already exists and is uncited. Sampled in `repository-checks`,
  where some requirements carry citations and some do not, **every** uncited requirement in the sample has a
  reaction — `gate_exit_classes`, `projection_register`, `dod_coherence`, `one_spelling`,
  `backlog_classification`, which is the sample itself rather than a count of it. That half needs no
  capability, and it is what makes *no reaction* distinguishable from *a reaction nobody cited*, which is the
  state this entry is actually filed for. **Two:** for the requirements a citation cannot reach — the majority
  of them, where a citation per SHALL would be the hand-maintained pointers this entry already refuses — find
  a derivation. That half is a capability to design, and designing
  it inside the closing review of a window would be the same haste this entry documents. What the earlier
  draft got wrong was not the second part; it was reaching it by asserting that the first part did not exist.

  **Part one was run against the sample this entry names, and it is not the cheap half — measured
  2026-09-02.** `PINNED-BY` attaches to a scenario and never to a requirement, so an *uncited requirement* is
  one with no citation under any of its scenarios — and across every tracked spec the **majority** are that,
  not a handful whose reaction someone forgot to name. The magnitudes are not copied here for the reason this
  entry gives below: `bound_register` prints the register's size on every clean run, and a figure written into
  this sentence is a second copy that can disagree with it. In `repository-checks`, six of the uncited
  requirements were citable and are cited, each citation verified by reading the test against the scenario's
  `THEN` rather than matched by name. A planted citation naming nothing fails
  `every_pinning_citation_resolves_to_one_registered_test`, so they are held rather than decoration.

  **The eight that remain are not *a reaction nobody cited*, and that is the finding.** This entry's binary —
  a `SHALL` has a reaction or it does not — has a third state, and the sample is mostly in it:

  - **Gate-only.** The reaction asserts the **clean tree**, and the requirement's `THEN` describes the
    refusal. `one_spelling`'s check asserts no second spelling of a token exists; the requirement says the
    check *refuses, naming every site and the constant that owns the token*, and nothing observes that. Same
    shape for the constant-against-its-enumerator requirement. A citation there would name a test that holds
    the direction nobody was worried about.
  - **A gate that returns early where CI runs it.** `capability_subjects`'s check returns early when no
    change is active, which is the state on `main` and on every `release/*` — its own comment says *a
    reaction that did not run reads as coverage*, and that the class is defended by review alone wherever it
    returns early. A citation would assert holding that does not happen there.
  - **Undefendable by construction.** *A projection is not a check and ships in nothing*, whose `THEN` tells
    a reader they are looking at a view. There is no observation to make, and this is the class recorded
    elsewhere in this file for a requirement stated as a property of the implementation rather than of the
    behaviour.

  **Part one is DECLINED at scale, decided 2026-09-03 on the measurement above rather than on its size.**
  What stays is what was done: the six requirements whose reaction genuinely holds their `THEN` are cited,
  and the third state is named. What is declined is extending that to the rest, and the reason is what a
  citation is held to. `bound_register` decides that the name resolves to exactly one registered test —
  proven by planting a name that resolves to nothing and watching it refuse — and **nothing decides the
  pairing**. `pin_bites` closes the neighbouring half where a mutation is declared, and even a biting pin
  ties its test to an author-chosen perturbation rather than to the requirement. So the binding a `PINNED-BY`
  asserts to a reader is a human's single reading, held thereafter by name resolution alone.

  The magnitudes are deliberately not restated here: `bound_register` prints the register's size on every
  clean run and `pin_bites` prints the part of the citation set it does not cover, and a figure copied into
  this entry would be a second copy that can disagree. What they say is that biting coverage is the exception
  and the cited fraction of requirements is a minority. Extending part one to the remainder would therefore
  produce hand-authored claims, on the order of the requirement count, each held by name resolution — which
  is the drifting artifact this entry's own second half refuses, arrived at from the other direction.

  *Why this is a decline and not a deletion.* The citations added are correct, and a renamed or deleted test
  turns them red, so they cannot rot silently. The claim being declined is that the road ends somewhere good,
  not that the steps taken were wrong.

  *Nothing is added to the specs by this decision, deliberately.* The biting limits are already declared —
  three unpinned bounds in `crates/kanhe/src/bounds.rs`, each tracking to the sibling entry — so stating them
  again here would be the *saying it twice held it nowhere* failure this file records for its own governance
  section. What is **not** declared anywhere is the higher fact above, that the requirement-to-test pairing is
  intent rather than shape; it stays prose with its reason, under the bar the `0.6.0` window set — a cannot-judge
  not a rule and needs no instance.

  *Reopening:* the derived binding of part two, or biting coverage becoming the rule rather than the
  exception, either of which changes what a citation is held to rather than how many there are.

  **A limit of the citation grammar, found by using it.** *The act completes* is held by
  `no_temporary_file_survives_the_wrapper`, which is defined in **two targets of one crate** — the merge
  wrapper's and the publish wrapper's — and the register refuses a name defined twice, saying *a citation
  names one defence, not a set*. The disambiguation this entry records is a **crate** prefix, which answers
  two crates and cannot answer two targets. That scenario is left uncited rather than pointed at half its
  defence, and extending the grammar to name a target is part of the second half rather than a step inside
  the first. *Version class:* not release-affecting; a new
  capability with its own gate, preserving every published API. *Authority:* `observation-bound-register`, which
  solves the same problem for bounds and is the shape any answer here would have to generalize.

  *Interim discipline:* `AGENTS.md` now requires a scenario entering main specs to name an existing reaction in
  the same change or arrive with a new guard and its negative run; a construction-guaranteed property stays in
  requirement prose instead. This does not close the entry — review convention cannot derive the missing binding —
  but it prevents sync from knowingly admitting another un-reacted scenario while the derived capability is designed.

- **A claim about this tree, written as prose, is held only where its author declared it.** *Class:*
  READY-PATCH. *Observed pressure:* two claims were found false in the 0.5.0 window by the same shape — a
  statement about an enumerable property of this repository, written with no producer and an outer edge wider
  than anything that reacts. `Cargo.toml`'s *syn quarantined to 渾儀 alone*, false from the moment the
  dev-table edge landed in the same window; and `PROJECT.md`'s *zero change directories have ever existed*,
  contradicted by `git log --all`, by two commit bodies on the tip that wrote it, and by a requirement with a
  scenario in `openspec/specs/reference-integrity/spec.md`. Both were true of a corpus neither named. *Observation
  source:* an adversarial contract review of `v0.4.0..HEAD`, plus this file's and `CHANGELOG.md`'s own record of
  the figure form of the same class — eight hand-written figures found wrong in a single change, which is what
  `crates/kanhe/src/census.rs` was built for. *Current reaction or bound:* `census` holds a **figure** written in
  a sentence its enumerating check declared, over tracked Markdown, and `repository-checks` declares two bounds
  for what that leaves — a count in a phrasing no census declares, and a census outside Markdown. Nothing at all
  holds a **set-membership or absolute** claim (`only X`, `never Y`, `alone`), in any carrier. *Risk:* the
  projected prose is what conditions every agent that loads it, so a claim wider than its reaction is a false
  statement of the law at the surface 潛移 makes most load-bearing. Bounded by the claims being prose: nothing an
  adopter resolves, and no exit class moves. *Promotion trigger:* a third instance, or the design below being
  written. *Version class:* patch; the carriers ship in no crate. *Authority:* this entry, `AGENTS.md`'s *Bind a
  claim to its measurement* and *A census is produced, never typed*, and `crates/kanhe/src/census.rs`.

  *Shape, because the obvious instrument is already refused:* a detector over prose was designed, measured three
  times and rejected, and that refusal has an observation source this entry does not get to ignore. The admitted
  shape is the one already built for figures — **declaration**: `Census` carries a phrase and produced figures,
  and the missing sibling is a declared phrase whose held value is a produced **set**, so *only 渾儀 names syn*
  is compared against the enumerator that answers it. What that cannot cover is stated here rather than
  discovered later: it reaches only claims some check enumerates the set for, so a role description like *the
  syn dependency lives here* stays a reviewer's, and coverage stays opt-in — declaring is an author's act. That
  residual is the honest floor of this repair, not an argument against it.

  **The floor was measured on 2026-09-03, and it decides the shape rather than qualifying it.** Two live
  instances of this class were found and repaired in the same change, both normative: `semantic-signature-
  coupling` said the AST observation's crate *is the only crate permitted to depend on `syn`*, and
  `semantic-dyn-trait-boundary` said the same in an aside. Both are false — `crates/kanhe/Cargo.toml` names
  `syn` in `[dev-dependencies]`, which is permitted, and the root manifest's own comment says so and names
  the occupant. Both now say *the only **packaged** crate that depends on `syn`*, which is the wording that
  manifest already reached and is exactly true.

  **Neither would have been caught by declaring a phrase, and the reason generalises: the instances of this
  class are claims their author believed.** A declared set-claim is armed by an author writing it down, and
  nobody declares a sentence they think is true — so the mechanism can hold the claims someone already
  doubted and not the ones that go wrong. The two above sat in specifications for windows, under a
  requirement whose own scenarios were narrower than its prose.

  What did find them was a sweep of the **absolute-quantifier vocabulary near a named enumerable subject** —
  *only*, *alone*, *the one place*, *no other* within a line of `syn` — over tracked documents. That is not
  the prose detector this repository designed, measured and rejected three times: it decides nothing, and it
  starts from a subject the tree already enumerates (which crates declare a dependency) rather than from the
  meaning of a sentence. It produces a review queue, which is the interim-instrument form `AGENTS.md` already
  states for the corpus-narrowing class.

  *So the shape above is not built, and this is the measured reason rather than a deferral:* a declared set
  is a producer for a claim someone chose to arm, and this class's instances are the claims nobody would
  have. The sweep is what the next window should run, from the subject side, at each pre-release review.


### WATCH / ACCEPTED / DECLINED / BUILT

- **渾儀 answers an unparseable `cfg_attr` two ways, and no source rustc accepts reaches the silent one.**
  *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* two readers of one question in one crate.
  `syn_util::cfg_attr_path_values` and its nested arm answer a failed `parse_args_with(cfg_attr_metas)` with
  `.ok()` — the whole attribute's `path` candidates dropped, the remap invisible — while
  `scan::items::extract_derives` answers the identical failure on the identical attribute with a scan
  error, its own doc saying *a `derive` whose arguments fail to parse is a scan error (exit 2) — "cannot
  judge" is never a silent skip*. The Core Contract states the policy the second follows: where an
  observation genuinely cannot decide, the reaction is exit 2 rather than a pass. *Observation source:* the
  two call sites, and that both use the same parser — `Punctuated<syn::Meta, Comma>::parse_terminated`,
  spelled `cfg_attr_metas` in one and `meta_list_parser` in the other — so the difference is the answer to
  the failure and nothing else. *Current reaction or bound:* none; the silent arm is reachable only from a
  `cfg_attr` whose applied metas syn rejects. *Risk:* if such a shape exists, a module's remap is silently
  invisible to 渾儀 alone while both byte scanners read it — a false negative of the class the Core
  Contract forbids, and a cross-dimension divergence. Bounded by the reach measurement below.
  *What was measured, and what it refutes:* the attempt to reach the silent arm through source rustc accepts
  used `#[cfg_attr(unix, path = "imp_unix.rs", unsafe(no_mangle))] pub mod imp;` — ordinary source since the
  2024 edition requires `unsafe(no_mangle)` in place of the bare spelling. rustc 1.96.0, edition 2021,
  `--crate-type lib` compiles it and applies the remap; syn parses `unsafe(no_mangle)` as a `Meta`; 渾儀
  answers `1` alongside the other two. The fixture is kept as
  `a_remap_sharing_its_cfg_attr_with_another_applied_attribute_is_still_read`, which is the direction the
  trigger below would reuse. *Promotion trigger:* a `cfg_attr` whose applied metas rustc accepts and
  `Punctuated<syn::Meta, Comma>::parse_terminated` rejects — stated as the property rather than as a
  spelling, because the parser's own coverage is what moves. A syn upgrade narrowing that parser fires it
  too. *Why not simply repaired:* replacing `.ok()` with a refusal is one line, and it would be a reaction
  built on an argument. *A violation is a rule, and a rule needs a reachable instance* — this one has a
  measurement that failed to find one, which is the entry rather than the fix. *Version class:* closing it
  would be a minor, by the false-negative rule. *Authority:* `PROJECT.md`'s Core Contract, and the doc
  comment on `extract_derives` that already states the policy.

  **Not fired, and the sweep that would decide it is the reach measurement above rather than a corpus
  read.** Recorded 2026-09-06 with the attempt that refuted the obvious candidate.

- **The OpenSpec capability lifecycle is retained and has never been exercised.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed
  pressure:* the steward's decision on 2026-08-31 to keep it — a new capability must go through OpenSpec —
  taken together with the measurement that produced the question: zero `docs(openspec): propose`/`sync`
  commits in the full history and `openspec/changes/**` untouched since `0.1.0`. The two are consistent, not
  in tension: the recent windows were patches and prose, and neither is a capability change. *Observation
  source:* that decision, and the path evidence behind the entry it closes, which is independent of commit
  subjects and so unaffected by the 2026-07-17 history rewrite. *Current reaction or bound:* none, and none
  is proposed — a process nobody has run is not a property a reaction can hold. *Risk:* the first capability
  change discovers whatever has drifted in a four-phase process that has never been run, at the moment
  someone is trying to use it. Bounded: half the section is already exercised, since the sync-evidence rule
  is followed and the tracked `archive/.gitkeep` is exactly as described. *Promotion trigger:* the first
  capability change to run it — at which point what this entry asks for is that whoever runs it records what
  did not work, rather than a sweep anyone can do beforehand. *Why not simply rehearsed:* a rehearsal would
  invent a capability to have one, and the lifecycle's whole subject is a change someone actually needs.
  *Version class:* not release-affecting; the section ships in no crate. *Authority:* `AGENTS.md` itself, and
  the steward's decision.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01 — and the sweep could not have decided it.** `openspec/changes/**` is still
  untouched since `0.1.0`, re-measured 2026-09-06: the only commits reaching it are the `0.1.0` release
  itself and one archive-scaffolding prune. What was inferred from that — *so no capability change has run
  the lifecycle*, and *whether the event has happened is decidable* — **does not follow, and the second
  sentence is false.** Step 5 of the lifecycle is *strip the change directory before the squash*, and `main`
  carries only squashed snapshots, so a change that ran the lifecycle in full leaves `openspec/changes/**`
  exactly as untouched as one that skipped it. The other observable is destroyed the same way: a
  `docs(openspec): propose` commit lives on a development branch, which the squash collapses. **Both
  observables are erased by the ritual they were read as observing**, so the emptiness is what either state
  looks like.

  So this is a **witness-only** trigger and always was, and reporting it twice with a date made it read as
  decided rather than as unobserved — which is worse than reading as merely armed. What the entry asks for is
  unchanged and now rests on the right footing: whoever runs the lifecycle records what did not work, because
  nobody else can find out afterwards. Re-measured for the window regardless: 15 specs under
  `openspec/specs/` were amended and **none added or removed**, so no new capability arose to run it.

- **This repository's own commit objects are kept out of tracked content by prose, and the reaction that
  would hold it reaches only live prose.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* two instances, one caught and
  one not. `no_live_document_cites_a_moment_a_fresh_clone_cannot_reach` refused a `BACKLOG.md` citation of the
  `0.5.0` release commit and named the reason — `main` carries one commit per release, so a development commit
  is unreachable from a fresh clone by construction. The second sat outside it:
  `crates/kanhe/tests/merge_workflow.rs` carries a real commit of this tree, made and squashed away inside the
  `0.5.0` window, that is contained in
  **no branch** and resolves only in a clone that still happens to hold it, used as an opaque fixture token in
  **code**. That reaction reads `.rs` as `Prose::LineComment("//")` — comments only — on the coherent ground
  that prose carries citations while code carries values, so the instance is outside its corpus by design
  rather than by oversight. Record documents are exempt for the same kind of reason. *Observation source:* a
  sweep of every 40-hex literal in tracked content, run when the published-artifact inventory was closed.
  *Current reaction or bound:* the rule is stated in `AGENTS.md`'s disposition table and has a reaction in
  live prose only. *Risk:* a reader meets a hash that resolves for the author and for nobody else, and cannot
  tell a fixture token from a reference. *Promotion trigger:* a **second** instance outside live prose. What
  it would take is small and already decidable, which is why the trigger is worth arming rather than
  guessing at: for every 40-hex literal in tracked content, `git cat-file -t` decides whether it is an object
  of **this** repository — and that same test excludes a third party's action pin without maintaining a list,
  because `owner/action@<sha>` does not resolve here. *Why not simply built:* one instance, in a repository
  whose own measurement says over half of the last window's landed work fed the machinery that judges it. A
  rule whose carrier is prose is a first-class form here — the census rule states that it has no repository
  check rather than leaving it to be discovered — and this is that form, with the upgrade path written down
  instead of rediscovered. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:*
  this entry, and `AGENTS.md`'s disposition table.

  **Swept 2026-09-01: not fired, and the instance this entry was written against is gone.** The uncaught
  one — `crates/kanhe/tests/merge_workflow.rs` carrying a commit of this tree as an opaque fixture token —
  was repaired inside the `0.6.0` window by `test(kanhe): the merge fixture's head resolves nowhere`; the token is
  now a synthetic value that resolves in no clone. So the *second instance* this trigger counts has no first
  standing behind it. Re-run over every 40-hex literal in tracked content: the ones that resolve as objects
  of this repository all sit in `docs/history/published-artifact-provenance.md`, a record, which is exempt
  for the reason the disposition table gives. **One correction to the upgrade path written above:** the
  proposed `git cat-file -t` answers from the local object store, so a commit that has been squashed away —
  exactly the hazard — reads as *not an object of this repository* in a fresh clone or in CI. The instrument
  is clone-dependent, which is the same defect that declines resolution for the citation reader below, and
  the two entries now share that one reason.

- **Over half of the 0.5.0 window's landed work touched the machinery that judges this repository and nothing
  an adopter receives.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* measured over the window's own history, one
  landed change per squash:

  ```bash
  # Against the RELEASE BRANCH's own history, never against `main`: `main` squashes a whole window into one
  # commit, so the same range there answers `0/1`. Measured — that is what the first re-run of this returned.
  git log --format='@%H' --name-only <previous-release-commit>..<release-branch> | awk '
    function flush() { if (seen) { t++; if (g && !p) gov++ } }
    /^@/  { flush(); seen=1; g=0; p=0; next }
    /^crates\/(kanhe|shengmo)\//                                    { g=1 }
    /^crates\/(xuanji|xingbiao|guibiao|hunyi|louke|tianheng)\/src\// { p=1 }
    END   { flush(); printf "%d/%d (%d%%)\n", gov, t, 100*gov/t }'
  ```

  *The command above replaced one written as `git log … | …`* — a pipeline with a literal ellipsis where the
  classifier belongs, which is a description of a measurement rather than one. It was filed in the same
  window, and by the same hand, that removed exactly that shape from `AGENTS.md`'s census rule; it was caught
  by trying to re-run it. An instrument that cannot be run is the figure form of the defect this entry is
  about.

  `284/540 (52%)` touched `crates/kanhe` or `crates/shengmo` and **no** published crate's `src/`; `100/540
  (18%)` touched a published source at all; `68/540 (12%)` touched product without touching governance. Two
  independent reviewers separately observed the other side of the same fact — that across sixteen rounds the
  published `0.5.0` surface moved by two lines of a private doc comment. *Observation source:* that
  classification, run over `v0.4.0..v0.5.0` after the release was cut — two tags, so the range resolves from
  any clone and neither end can be renamed; the command is written out so
  the next window's figure is derived rather than recalled. *Current reaction or bound:* none, and none is
  proposed — a ratio is not a property a reaction can hold without deciding what counts as product, which is
  a judgement over intent. This entry is the instrument and the record of one reading. *Risk:* the window's
  own evidence is that each repair produced the next round's finding — *every reaction built in the `0.6.0` window
  had a defect found in the next round, three of three* — so a system that generates work proportional to
  itself will keep spending the budget on itself unless the figure is looked at. **The instrument undercounts, measured 2026-09-03 later in the `0.6.0` window, and the
  correction reverses its verdict.** Its classifier calls a change *governance* only when it touches
  `crates/{kanhe,shengmo}`. Governance here is also carried by `BACKLOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `openspec/specs/**`, `docs/**` and `.github/**` — so a window spent almost entirely on those
  reads as a **fall**. Over `v0.5.0..release/0.6.0` the classifier as written answers `13/42 (30%)` against
  `0.5.0`'s 52%; classified by carrier it answers **42/42 (100%)**, of which `29/42 (69%)` touched no code at
  all, and **0/42 touched any published crate's `src/`** where `0.5.0` had 18%. The share did not fall: the
  work moved into a category the classifier ignores, which is the corpus defect this file records under its
  own name elsewhere — a reader whose subject is narrower than the claim it serves.

  **Those figures were taken at 42 of the window's 100 landed changes, and one of them has since inverted.**
  Re-derived 2026-09-06 over the same range with the command above: the classifier as written answers
  `34/100 (34%)`, by carrier `100/100 (100%)`, and **21/100 (21%) touched a published crate's `src/`** —
  above `0.5.0`'s 18%, where the reading at 42 had none. The window's second half is where the lexical
  false-negative closures landed, and those are product. So the by-carrier verdict stands and *the share did
  not fall* still holds on it, while the sentence carrying the sharpest form of the claim — no published
  source at all — was true of an **unfinished window** and is not true of the window.

  *That is this entry's own discipline broken by this entry.* Its observation source says the figure was run
  *after the release was cut*, which is what makes a window's ratio a fact about a window; a mid-window
  reading recorded in the same sentence shape is a figure attached to an incomplete corpus. Nothing
  disagreed with it because nobody re-ran it. Both readings are kept, each stating the count it was taken
  over, so the next comparison is against a number that says when. **`0.6.0`'s figure is the one taken after
  its cut, and neither of these is it.**

  ```bash
  git log --format='@%H' --name-only <previous-release-commit>..<release-branch> | awk '
    function flush() { if (seen) { t++; if (p) prod++; else if (g || d) gov++; if (!p && !g && d) doc++ } }
    /^@/  { flush(); seen=1; g=0; p=0; d=0; next }
    /^crates\/(kanhe|shengmo)\//                                    { g=1 }
    /^crates\/(xuanji|xingbiao|guibiao|hunyi|louke|tianheng)\/src\// { p=1 }
    /^(BACKLOG|CHANGELOG|AGENTS|PROJECT|COOKBOOK|README)|^openspec\/|^docs\/|^\.github\// { d=1 }
    END   { flush(); printf "product %d/%d, governance %d/%d, documents-only %d/%d\n",
                     prod, t, gov, t, doc, t }'
  ```

  *And this correction lands in the 69%*, which is the shape of the problem rather than an aside: every act of
  pruning governance stock in the `0.6.0` window — a reader layer deleted, deferred entries closed or reclassified, a
  queue halved — was itself recorded in a governance document, and the recording is counted where the pruning
  is not. What the corrected figure asks for is not a better classifier. It is a window in which something an
  adopter receives moves.

  *First re-run, mid-window and superseded by the correction above:* **8/17
  (47%)** against `0.5.0`'s 52%, with `kanhe` down from 37,154 lines to 36,460 — the first window in which it
  shrank. **Neither number carries much yet.** Seventeen changes is a sample two differently-classified
  commits would move ten points, and nearly all of them are the same hand working on governance, so the
  figure largely measures who was working rather than whether the bar changed anything. The crate also fell
  by less than the migrations removed, because the same window added elsewhere. What the re-run establishes
  is that the instrument runs and the direction is not wrong; a window of ordinary size is what would make it
  evidence. *Promotion trigger:* the
  next window's figure not falling. What that asks for is **retiring rules, not softening verdicts**: the
  weight is in how much of the tree is under reaction at all, not in how loudly a reaction speaks. A first
  decidable question for that, unasked so far: which refusal sites have only ever fired on fixtures.

  *That question was asked and it does not discriminate.* Every direction in `kanhe` builds a synthetic
  fixture — that is the method — so the answer is all of them. A second discriminator was tried, *which sites
  no release note names*, and it measures how release notes are written rather than whether a site earns its
  place: nearly every site is named by no release note. **And the discriminator dies on the kind rather than
  on the count:** many of those sites are cannot-judge, a reader declining to answer where it cannot see, and
  retiring one of those trades a refusal for a silent skip. No proportion is written here — the register
  records each site's identity and not its kind, so a share would be a figure nothing re-derives, which is the
  defect the pair originally in this sentence demonstrated by going stale against the register inside the
  same window.
  Retiring one of those trades a refusal for a silent skip, which is the direction the Core Contract forbids.
  So there is no retirement list, and producing one would have meant defending a cut the measurement does not
  support.

  *Where the reducible weight actually is, measured:* tests are 26,568 of `kanhe`'s 37,229 lines, and beside
  them stand 98 declared bounds and the WATCH queue itself. None of that shrinks by retiring refusal sites.

  *What was done instead.* Retiring rules addresses the **stock**; the `0.6.0` window's own reviews recorded a
  mechanism producing more — every reaction built had a defect found in the next round, three of three. A bar
  on the **rate** is in `AGENTS.md` beside the carrier taxonomy, which until now answered which binding a
  carrier admits and never whether the claim earns one: a cannot-judge needs no instance, a violation needs a
  reachable one, and a gap that exists only in an argument gets prose and a trigger.
  *Why not simply built:* stated above — the classification rests on which crates are the product, which the
  manifest answers today and would have to keep answering for a reaction to be sound; and the remedy the
  figure argues for is removal, which no reaction performs. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal,
  shipping in no crate. *Authority:* this entry.

- **Twenty-seven inner comments in published crates index their provenance by review round, and the reaction
  over doc comments does not reach them.** *Class:* BUILT / HISTORY. *Observed pressure:* measured in the 0.5.0 window, by
  `grep -rnE 'round[- ][0-9]+'` over every published crate's `src`: both doc-comment lines and inner-comment
  (`//`) lines carried a round number. The doc-comment ones are repaired and
  `crates/kanhe/tests/doc_provenance.rs` now refuses them; the inner-comment ones are outside its corpus by
  construction, and
  that boundary is asserted by a direction rather than claimed. *Observation source:* the `v0.4.0..HEAD`
  comment-hygiene review, and the enumeration its triage produced. *Current reaction or bound:* none over the
  inner form. *Risk, bounded rather than assumed:* a `//` note is not part of any item's contract and reaches
  no rustdoc — measured, none of the 28 doc sites attached to a `pub` item either, so nothing here was ever
  adopter-facing. What it costs is a reader of the source meeting a moment-name instead of a reason, and an
  agent with the file in context imitating it. *Promotion trigger:* an inner comment whose round number is the
  only identifier of the invariant it guards — the shape that makes stripping it lossy — or the doc-comment
  corpus being widened for an unrelated reason, at which point widening it once more costs nothing. *Version
  class:* patch; comments in published crates, no API or behaviour. *Authority:* `AGENTS.md`'s *What earns a
  place in a doc comment* table, whose disposition for a review round number is `provenance`, and
  `repository-checks`'s requirement holding the doc-comment half.

  **Built 2026-09-03.** Every one of the 27 inner comments across `guibiao`, `hunyi` and `louke` was
  reviewed and stripped of its round index while preserving its invariant and observation source,
  bringing inner comments into alignment with `AGENTS.md` doc comment discipline. Clean run measured
  with `git grep -nE 'round[- ][0-9]+' crates/*/src` returning zero lines.

- **`merge_workflow`'s fixture takes `jq` from the host without declaring it, and its absence reads as fifteen
  defects in the subject.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* measured 2026-08-23 on a machine where `jq`
  is not installed — 15 of that target's 30 cases fail, each reporting
  `bin/gh: line 77: jq: command not found` alongside the merge message *cannot read what CI said about this
  pull request, which is not the same fact as CI having agreed*. **The wrapper is right and the fixture is
  not:** `scripts/merge-pr.sh` could not read a verdict, so it declined to judge and said so — exactly its
  contract. What is wrong is that the fixture's `gh` stub pipes through a host tool it never declares, so a
  missing interpreter presents as a failing subject, and the operator reads fifteen findings about CI when
  the state met was one absent binary. Same shape the `0.5.0` window closed twice elsewhere: a diagnosis SHALL state
  what to do about the state it met, not assert what is true of the world. *Observation source:* the
  `v0.4.0..release/0.5.0` campaign's verification runs, where the suite passed earlier the same day and the
  binary disappeared beneath it. *Current reaction or bound:* none — no capability spec states the host tools
  a reaction requires, and nothing checks for one before the reaction runs. *Risk, bounded rather than
  assumed:* local only. GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` images ship `jq`, so CI is unaffected, and `kanhe` publishes
  nothing — no adopter build and no released artifact can meet this. *Promotion trigger:* a second reaction
  fixture found taking a host tool it does not declare, or a CI image that stops shipping `jq`. Either makes
  this a class rather than one stub, and the repair is then the same for both: the fixture states what it
  needs and stops before the subject when it is absent.

  *Trigger measured, not waited for — in the 0.5.0 window, and it has not fired.* The decidable half of it is
  enumerable: a stub is executed only where a test puts its directory on `PATH`, and exactly **two** test
  targets do — `publish_workflow` and `merge_workflow`. `merge_workflow`'s `gh` stub pipes through `jq`, which
  is this entry. `publish_workflow`'s `cargo` stub uses `printf` and `[[` and reaches no host tool at all. Every
  other occurrence of a host-tool name under `crates/*/tests` is either prose or a fixture's *subject* rather
  than something executed — `echo tail # cut` and `curl "$url#frag"` in `source_regions`, which are text the
  region classifier reads. So the class has one instance by measurement rather than by nobody having looked,
  and the `PATH` criterion is what a later sweep should re-run rather than a tool-name list, which cannot be
  known to be complete.

- **WATCH: a corrupt tag ref and an absent one are one exit status, so the publish gate cannot tell them
  apart.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the tag read was split so that git declining to answer is no
  longer reported as *there is no tag*, and one residue survives the split: a ref FILE holding unparseable
  content exits the same status as a ref that does not exist. *Observation source, reconstructible:* measured
  on 2026-08-21 in a scratch repository —

  ```bash
  git init -q . && git commit -q --allow-empty -m x
  printf 'garbage\n' > .git/refs/tags/broken
  git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/tags/broken; echo $?   # 1
  git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/tags/absent;  echo $?   # 1
  ```

  and the bare form collapses them differently rather than better: both answer `128`, which is also what a
  directory that is no repository answers. *Current reaction or bound:* the gate reports **absent** for both,
  which is the safe direction — it refuses the publish either way, and the operator's next act is to look at
  the tag. Not declared as an observation bound, deliberately: a declared bound is pinned by a direction over
  its own WHEN, and this WHEN produces the same answer as the case beside it, so a pin would compare a value
  with itself. *Risk:* an operator told *there is no tag* when the tag's ref is corrupt goes to create one and
  meets a ref that already exists. Bounded to a diagnostic: no publish proceeds on either reading. *Promotion
  trigger:* a git version or a read that separates the two — `for-each-ref` and `cat-file` were both measured
  and neither does at this layer — or one occurrence of a corrupt ref in front of a real release. *Version
  class:* patch; the gate ships in no package. *Authority:* `publish-source-integrity`, whose class rule this
  residue sits inside rather than outside.

  A neighbouring case IS separated and is recorded so the two are not confused: a ref holding a well-formed
  sha with no object behind it exits `0`, is read as present, and the tag-object read downstream refuses it as
  unreadable.

  **Not fired, re-measured 2026-09-01 on git 2.50.1.** The scratch-repository probe recorded above still
  answers the same way: `rev-parse --verify --quiet` exits `1` for a corrupt ref and `1` for an absent one,
  and `for-each-ref` exits `0` for both. Neither separates them, and no corrupt ref has stood in front of a
  release.

- **WATCH: no reaction asks what each repository check observed, and the check surface is now an order of
  magnitude larger than the product it guards.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the drift law — *no
  target or name without a reaction*, *no drift type without an observation source* — is stated over the
  product's boundaries and has never been turned on the repository checks themselves. Every check has a
  reason written in its header; nothing enumerates which ones have an **observation source**, in the sense
  this file demands of a backlog entry: a thing that happened, not a shape that could. *Observation source,
  reconstructible:* measured at `HEAD` on 2026-08-21, from **one** enumeration so the two sides cannot be
  counted under different rules:

  ```bash
  git diff --numstat --no-renames v0.4.0..HEAD -- crates > /tmp/n
  grep '/src/' /tmp/n | grep -vE 'crates/(kanhe|shengmo)/' | grep -vE '/tests?(\.rs|/)' \
    | awk '{a+=$1} END{print a}'                                          # product logic: +2230
  grep -E 'crates/(kanhe|shengmo)/' /tmp/n | awk '{a+=$1} END{print a}'   # machinery:     +28687
  ```

  `--no-renames` is load-bearing rather than decorative: nine fixture moves render as
  `crates/{tianheng => shengmo}/…`, which a path-shaped filter reads and a name-shaped one does not, and the
  two forms disagreed on both figures until the enumeration was pinned. No file count is given — the ratio is
  the claim, and the counts were the half that broke.
  and against this file's own anchored figure for the same window — 46 of the last 60 commits (78%) scoped
  `kanhe`, 38 (64%) typed `fix`. *Current reaction or bound:* none. `observation-bound-register` enumerates
  where each check *stops*, which is the opposite question; nothing enumerates why each check *exists*.
  *Risk, and both readings stated because the evidence does not choose between them:* the ratio is what
  dogfooding a governance thesis looks like, and the checks with a recorded observation source — a release
  dated four days behind the day it would be cut, a publish from the wrong branch, nine squash subjects
  carrying `(#N)`, a prelude promise narrowing unobserved — are the argument for it. The risk is the
  remainder: a check built from a shape someone imagined would be exactly the name-without-an-observation
  the drift law refuses in product code, and it would be indistinguishable from the others by reading, since
  every header reasons well. *Promotion trigger:* an audit that asks each `crates/{kanhe,shengmo}/tests/*`
  target *what did this catch, and when* — enumerated from tracked content the way
  `observation-bound-register` is, never hand-listed — and finds a target with no answer. Deliberately not
  attempted here: it is the audit-cycle shape `PROJECT.md` records, whose own decision says larger surfaces
  are named and not committed to, and running it is a window's work rather than a review round's. *Version
  class:* patch; both crates ship in no package, so any retirement it produced would reach no adopter.
  *Authority:* this entry, `PROJECT.md`'s drift law and its audit-cycle decision, `governance-dogfood`.

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01.** No sweep decides this: the trigger is an audit nobody has run, and
  this entry already says running it is a window's work rather than a review round's. What would settle it
  is the audit's own output — each target's answer to *what did this catch, and when* — enumerated from
  tracked content, and there is nothing to look at until someone does that.

- **WATCH: the prose-claim class is filed but not closed, and no rule says how much of a class must react.**
  *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* `AGENTS.md` says a governance rule measured un-reacted is *given a
  reaction or filed, in the same change* — and filing counts as answering. The `READY-PATCH` entry above
  discharges that duty for the prose-claim class by proposing the declaration; this one records that the
  declaration does not close it, because its coverage is an author's act. What no rule in this repository
  answers is when a class whose only instrument is opt-in has been answered *enough*. *Observation source:*
  this file's own history of the figure form of the same class — declared 2026-08, reacted for one sentence,
  and the eight-figure change that followed it. *Current reaction or bound:* none, and by construction: this
  is a question about the coverage of a discipline, not about a shape anything observes. *Risk:* the class is
  rediscovered once a window and each rediscovery pays the measurement again; bounded by every carrier being
  prose. **Cannot fire yet, and saying so is the point.** Its condition is a window *after* the `READY-PATCH`
  entry it names has landed, and that entry has not: it is still `READY-PATCH`, so no window has yet begun
  under the state this trigger measures from. Evaluated 2026-09-06 and recorded as **unevaluable** rather
  than as *not fired*, which is the distinction `AGENTS.md` now requires of a verdict — a trigger whose
  precondition is unmet has not been observed and has not passed. *Promotion trigger:* a third window in which this class costs a review round after the `READY-PATCH`
  above lands. *Version class:* patch. *Authority:* `AGENTS.md`'s *A repair loop is a diagnosis, not a
  schedule*.

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01.** No sweep decides this: it turns on a third window in which the class
  costs a review round, which only whoever pays that round can report. The `READY-PATCH` it waits behind has
  not landed, so the count cannot have advanced either way.

- **WATCH: The Definition of Done and CI mirror each other in one direction only.** *Class:* WATCH.
  *Observed pressure:* `dod_coherence` asserts that every command in `AGENTS.md`'s list appears in CI, and
  nothing asserts the converse. *Observation source:* a review measured it, and a record in the `0.5.0` window had
  already asserted the converse existed — three named CI steps run suites the local list does not name
  (`release_coherence`/`publish_source`, `dod_coherence`, `bound_register`), all covered today by the listed
  `cargo test --workspace --all-features`, and `cargo test -p louke` is the one named step that run does not
  cover. It is in the list because a person remembered. *Current reaction or bound:* the one direction.
  *Risk:* the DoD's own prose records this exact class — *the gate a contributor actually runs went blind to
  the exact class this job had just learned to catch* — and the residue is a named CI step whose local
  coverage nothing holds. *Promotion trigger, rewritten 2026-09-01 over the corpus it watches:* a CI step the Definition of Done
  list does not name **and** the listed `cargo test --workspace --all-features` does not cover, or a
  contributor's green local run followed by a red CI job on a step the list does not name. The two halves
  are joined because either alone is already satisfied by steps that are harmless: measured on 2026-09-01,
  `cargo test -p shengmo --test examples_suite` and `cargo test -p kanhe --test pin_bites` are both gated on
  environment variables the workspace run does not set, so the workspace run covers neither — and both are
  in the list, which is the property that makes them safe. The hazard is a step the list does not name;
  the old trigger said coverage where this entry means naming, and so stood satisfied twice over while
  the residue it watches was unchanged. *Version class:*
  patch; governance and CI configuration only. *Authority:* `repository-checks`. *Shape:* assert the converse
  — every named CI step running a suite is either in the list or covered by a listed command — which needs a
  reader that can say which suites a listed command covers, and that is the half not built.

- **WATCH: The two irreversible-act wrappers are one lifecycle written twice.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed
  pressure:* `scripts/merge-pr.sh` and `scripts/publish.sh` share a whole shape — resolve the repository root,
  parse an argument allowlist, open a verdict channel, run the gate, read the class, clean up, `exec` the
  tool — and a review measured most of `publish.sh`'s code as byte-identical to its sibling, including
  every named construct they share (`cannot_judge`, `refuse`, `require_a_verdict`, `require_one_pass`, the
  ERR trap with its bash-5 measurement paragraph, and the mktemp/EXIT-trap/pre-exec `rm` sequence) plus both
  class constants and their diagnostics. **No count is given**: this entry first carried one, and the very
  repair recorded two sentences below it — `merge-pr.sh` gaining `refuse` — moved the figure in the commit
  that wrote it. The trigger reads the shape, not the arithmetic. *Observation source:* that review, plus the drift it already
  produced and which is repaired with it — `publish.sh` routed every argument refusal through a `refuse()`
  helper while `merge-pr.sh` spelled `printf … >&2; exit 2` inline at every arm, against
  `repository-checks`'s own clause that *the classification SHALL be chosen in one place per wrapper*.
  `merge-pr.sh` now has that helper. *Current reaction or bound:* `gate_exit_classes` holds the class
  constants and the presence of `require_one_pass` across both wrappers, with set equality in both
  directions — so the **identities** cannot drift; nothing holds the bodies or the reasoning, which is what
  did. *Risk:* the cost is recorded verbatim by `hermetic_git.rs`'s own header for its own extraction — *the
  undocumented copy was then given a doc written without reading the other, and that doc overclaimed*.
  *Promotion trigger:* a second divergence between the two wrappers' shared constructs, or a defect found in
  one copy and not the other. **Not fired, measured 2026-09-06** — the reading matters because `merge-pr.sh`
  grew by 58 lines in `0.6.0` while `publish.sh` was not touched at all, which is the shape a divergence
  would arrive in. Every named shared construct is present in both and the structural ones match in count
  (`require_a_verdict`, `require_one_pass`, the `mktemp`, and the ERR and EXIT traps); the growth is the
  post-gate re-reads of a pull request's base and head, which `publish.sh` has no counterpart for because it
  judges no pull request. The race those close does exist on the publish side and is filed separately as one
  the wrapper can only narrow — found in both and answered differently for a stated reason, which is not the
  drift this trigger watches for. *Version class:* patch; both scripts reach no tarball. *Authority:*
  `repository-checks`. *Shape:* one sourced library under `scripts/` holding the shared constructs and the
  verdict-file lifecycle, with `gate_exit_classes` widened to assert **one** definition site rather than two
  agreeing copies. Filed rather than done because the extraction lands at a release cut and the two
  wrappers stand in front of the two acts that cannot be undone — the one place where a refactor's own risk
  outweighs the drift it removes until the release is out.

  **The trigger has fired, and what answered it is the narrower half.** A `v0.4.0..HEAD` review found the
  second form this entry names — *a defect found in one copy and not the other*: every refusal in
  `scripts/publish.sh` reached its class through a helper, while `scripts/merge-pr.sh` chose it inline at four
  sites, two of them defined above the helpers they should have called. Both wrappers now delegate every stop
  to a single `cannot_judge`, so each spells its diagnostic prefix once, and
  `each_wrapper_chooses_its_exit_class_in_one_place` counts the `exit` statements in executed shell text —
  which turns *chosen in one place* from a property a reader checks into one a run decides. **The extraction
  itself is still not done**, and the reason above is unchanged: it lands at a release cut, in front of the two
  acts that cannot be undone. The convergence performed was inside each wrapper, adding no file and no
  `source` path to resolve; the cross-wrapper library this entry proposes is what stays filed. Saying which
  half a change did is what *A repair loop is a diagnosis* asks for, so it is said here rather than left to
  the next review to re-derive.

  **Two review rounds later the copies still have not diverged, which reads as the trigger not-yet-fired
  rather than as safe.** Four changes have touched `scripts/merge-pr.sh` since — the exit class, the
  no-evidence class, a relative anchor, a reflowed comment — and every one landed outside the shared region or
  was applied to both wrappers in the same commit. Measured in the 0.5.0 window: of `scripts/publish.sh`'s 109
  executed lines, 66 appear verbatim in its sibling. So the identities agree and the bodies agree, and nothing
  made either of those happen — a reviewer did. An adversarial review named the consequence precisely: the
  copies not having diverged is what makes the extraction **cheap now and expensive later**. That is an
  argument about timing rather than against the reason this stays filed, which is unchanged — it lands at a
  release cut, in front of the two acts that cannot be undone. Promoting it is the first work of the window
  after this release rather than the last of this one.

- **ACCEPTED DEBT: A branch name is governed by prose alone, and the gate that would hold it is declined.**
  *Class:* ACCEPTED DEBT, re-classified 2026-09-01 when the trigger fired and the steward re-decided; WATCH
  until then, and the sentence that first declined a check was wrong about why. *Observed pressure:* `AGENTS.md` requires `<type>/<scope>-<slug>` with `<type>` drawn from
  the Conventional Commit set, and nothing reads a branch name at any point. Measured over every merged pull
  request into `release/0.5.0`: **84 head branches open with `change/`** — the role `AGENTS.md` itself records
  as retired — and **seven carry no `/` at all** (`release-prep`, `refusal-register-reads-rust-not-text`,
  `docs-agents-bind-a-claim-to-its-measurement` among them), against 180 `fix/`, 69 `docs/`, 17 `test/`,
  10 `feat/`, 9 `refactor/`, 2 `ci/` and 1 `build/`. Those are history and cannot be repaired; what they
  measure is that the convention drifts unobserved, which is the condition under which `AGENTS.md` says a
  governance rule *is read as license rather than law*. *Observation source:* measured in the 0.5.0 window by
  `gh pr list --state merged --base release/0.5.0 --json headRefName`. *Current reaction or bound:* none. The
  sentence that declined one has been repaired in the same change for a different fault — it gave the
  constitution's reason for a repository check's conclusion, and compared itself to a rule that has since
  acquired a gate — so the decision is now open rather than settled by a premise that did not hold.
  *Risk:* low and bounded, since a branch name reaches no artifact and no adopter; the cost is that the type a
  branch declares and the type its squash lands as can disagree, which is the disagreement the naming rule
  exists to prevent. *Promotion trigger, rewritten 2026-09-01 over the corpus it watches:* a merged pull request whose head
  branch does not parse as `<type>/<scope>-<slug>` with `<type>` in the admitted set, or whose parsed type
  differs from its squash subject's, or a second retired role accumulating. **So rewritten it fires, on the
  `0.6.0` window's own work.** Measured 2026-09-06 over the window's own commit range, which resolves from
  any clone, rather than over a branch name, which does not:

  ```bash
  # Every pull request whose squash reached the range below, addressed by that RANGE. A `--base` filter names a
  # branch, and a branch is renameable — measured, that is how this figure was lost once.
  git log v0.5.0..release/0.6.0 --format='%H' | while read h; do
    gh api "repos/:owner/:repo/commits/$h/pulls" --jq '.[]|[.head.ref,.title]|@tsv'
  done | sort -u | awk -F'\t' '
    { split($1,b,"/"); split($2,s,/[(:]/)
      if (index($1,"/")==0)  print "NO-TYPE   " $1
      else if (b[1]!=s[1])   print "DISAGREE  " $1 " -> " $2 }'
  ```

  **103 pull requests, three offences.** `test-kanhe-a-fixture-sha-that-resolves-nowhere` carries no `/` at
  all, so it declares no type for a subject to disagree with; `fix/tianheng-the-usage-block-has-one-owner`
  landed as `docs(tianheng): …`; and `gov/spec-prose-discipline` declares a type that is **not in the
  admitted set** and landed as `docs(agents): …`. The last two are the disagreement this naming rule exists
  to prevent, and `gov` is a second retired role — the third clause of the trigger, which had never been
  seen to fire.

  **The figure was three times smaller while it was addressed by a branch name.** It read *22 pull requests
  merged into `release/0.6.0`*, that branch was renamed, and GitHub does not retarget a **merged** pull
  request's recorded base — so the sentence came to name a set not containing its own evidence, and a repair
  that merely restored the old name kept a corpus that had been the wrong one from the start. A branch is
  renameable and a version that never shipped resolves through nothing; the commit range is neither. The
  command is carried here so the next reading disagrees with a re-run instead of passing silently. The commit
  that first wrote this measurement is titled *a trigger is a predicate, and nothing holds one to its
  corpus*, and the corpus it named was a branch.

  The old trigger could not fire on it: this entry's own *Observed pressure* had already counted seven
  slash-less branches in `0.5.0`, so the shape was known when the trigger was written, and the trigger was
  written over the other two. The convention drifted in the very next window, by the sole contributor,
  after the steward had caught it once — which is the condition `AGENTS.md` names for a rule read as
  license rather than law, now measured rather than argued. *Version class:* patch; no crate is touched. *Authority:* `repository-checks`.
  *Shape, kept written down though declined:* `scripts/merge-pr.sh` already resolves the pull request and
  could read `headRefName` beside the title it re-reads, and `merge_message_gate` already owns the admitted
  type set — so the judgement is one comparison against a list that exists, not a new vocabulary. A check
  refusing the historical `change/` branches would refuse nothing live, so that blocker dissolves for a
  merge-time reader; it is recorded here so a later steward does not re-derive it.

  **The trigger fired and the decision was taken rather than deferred again: the gate is declined.** Two
  reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one. First, the cost this entry itself measures is bounded —
  a branch name reaches no artifact, no adopter and no published crate, and the one drifted branch in the
  `0.6.0` window landed a squash whose own subject was well-formed, so nothing downstream carried the fault.
  Second, the repair is a **new gate on the merge ritual**, and this repository's standing goal for the
  window is that its governance-only share of landed work must fall. Closing a bounded prose-level gap by
  adding a reaction that runs in front of every merge moves that number the wrong way, and it does so to
  hold a convention whose entire consequence is legibility.

  What is accepted, stated plainly rather than left implicit: `AGENTS.md`'s branch-naming rule stays
  unenforced, and this file now records that as a decision instead of an omission. *Reopening trigger:* a
  branch name reaching an artifact, an adopter or a published crate — the premise that bounds the cost — or
  a squash landing with a subject type that contradicts its branch's, which is the disagreement the naming
  rule exists to prevent and the one shape whose cost is not merely legibility.

- **ACCEPTED DEBT: A release date is only held at the snapshot, and an earlier check would be noise.**
  *Class:* ACCEPTED DEBT. *Observed pressure:* the dated CHANGELOG section for the version under preparation
  carries a date nothing compares until the `release: X.Y.Z` commit exists. Measured on this repository: the
  `0.5.0` section stood at `2026-08-16` while the branch tip was six days later, and one earlier release was
  prepared four days behind its cut. *Observation source:* `release_coherence_gate`'s own comment records the
  four-day instance, and the six-day one was found by an adversarial review of `v0.4.0..HEAD`.
  *Current reaction or bound:* `release-coherence#release-date-disagrees-with-its-commit` holds the date
  against the commit at `State::Snapshot`, so a stale date **cannot reach a release** — it fails the cut and
  the operator fixes it before retrying. The cost is one failed cut, not a wrong published date.
  *Risk:* bounded to that retry. *Promotion trigger:* a cut failing on this twice, which would mean the
  ritual sentence is not being read. *Version class:* patch. *Authority:* `release-coherence`.
  *Shape, and why the obvious one was declined:* the check could compare the dated section against **HEAD's**
  date during preparation — a cut happens at or after HEAD, so a date earlier than HEAD is already wrong, and
  that would have caught both instances the day they appeared. It is declined because preparation spans days:
  the reaction would turn red on the first commit of every new day and ask for an edit whose value is a
  guess, which is a refusal that is right at one moment and wrong the rest of the time — the same trade
  `AGENTS.md` records for the untracked-file guard it declined for the Definition of Done. `AGENTS.md` states
  the step instead, at the moment the value stops being a guess.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01.** No release has been cut since `0.5.0`, so the *twice* this trigger counts
  cannot have advanced.

- **WATCH: A commit reaching a `release/*` branch without a pull request meets no CI.** *Class:* WATCH.
  *Observed pressure:* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggers on `push` to `main` and on `pull_request`, so a
  commit pushed straight onto a release branch runs no job at all — the branch that every development change
  squashes into, and the one a release snapshot is cut from. *Observation source:* measured in the 0.5.0 window by
  comparing every commit in `v0.4.0..HEAD` against the squash commit of every merged pull request
  (`gh pr list --state merged --limit 800 --json mergeCommit`): **428 of 428 commits resolve to a pull
  request**, so the pressure is structural rather than observed. The fifty that name no `release/0.5.0` pull
  request are `release/0.5.0`'s, carried forward. *Current reaction or bound:* `require_changed_files` in
  `scripts/merge-pr.sh` closes the adjacent shape this was first mistaken for — a pull request whose diff is
  empty because the content was committed onto the release branch itself — and `require_ci_green` refuses a
  merge whose rollup is not green, so every path *through the wrapper* is covered. Nothing covers a push that
  never opens a pull request. *Risk:* a release snapshot cut from content no job ever built. *Promotion
  trigger:* the first commit on a release branch that resolves to no pull request. *Version class:* patch; no
  crate is touched. *Authority:* `repository-checks`. *Shape:* `branches: [main, 'release/**']` on the `push`
  trigger — one line, whose cost is a full eight-job run on every push to a release branch, including the
  worktree-building `pin_bites`. Filed rather than done because this repository's own rule is evidence before
  promotion, and the evidence measured zero.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01 and re-swept 2026-09-06 at 101 commits.** Every commit on `release/0.6.0`
  resolves to a merged pull request, asked of the API per commit
  (`gh api repos/:owner/:repo/commits/<sha>/pulls`) rather than by matching against a listing, which is the
  direction that cannot miss a pull request the listing's limit truncated. **101 of 101.** The structural gap
  is unchanged; the evidence still measures zero.

- **WATCH: The declared MSRV is observable only in CI.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* `rust-version =
  "1.85"` lives in `Cargo.toml` and nothing pins the local toolchain, so the Definition of Done compiles on
  whatever the contributor has. Measured: a single `if let … && …` the default toolchain accepts and 1.85
  refuses was green locally through **nineteen consecutive merges** and red in CI's `msrv` job the whole time.
  *Observation source:* that window, recorded in `scripts/merge-pr.sh`'s own `require_ci_green` header.
  *Current reaction or bound:* `require_ci_green` refuses a merge whose rollup is not green, so the specific
  cost that window paid — merging past a red MSRV job — cannot recur through the wrapper. What remains is
  latency: the contributor learns from CI rather than from the local list. *Risk:* a round trip per MSRV
  regression. *Promotion trigger:* a second failure only the `msrv` job catches. *Version class:* patch.
  *Authority:* `repository-checks`. *Shape:* **not** a `rust-toolchain` file — pinning the workspace to 1.85
  would take `--all-features` clippy off the current toolchain, trading a live check for convenience. What
  would close it is an MSRV step in the Definition of Done, which installs a toolchain and rebuilds, so it
  belongs beside `pin_bites` as an env-gated line rather than in the ordinary list.

  **The trigger has fired, and two of this entry's own premises were wrong.** The recorded trigger was *a
  second failure only the `msrv` job catches*, and it happened: a `let` chain in an `if` condition — stable
  well past `rust-version` — compiled on the default toolchain, passed the whole local Definition of Done, and
  failed CI's MSRV job with `E0658`. That is not a shape resembling the nineteen-merge window this entry
  records; it is the **same construct**, `if … && let …`, written again in the repository that wrote the
  paragraph about it.

  What the firing corrected. *Installs a toolchain* is not a cost here: `1.85` was already present on the
  machine that hit this, so the step is a rebuild and nothing more, and it ran clean in minutes when finally
  asked — `cargo +1.85 build --workspace` and `cargo +1.85 test --workspace --all-features`. And the
  mitigation this entry credits held exactly as written: `require_ci_green` refuses a red rollup, so the
  defect cost one CI round rather than reaching a release branch. Filed rather than promoted for the reason
  the sibling wrapper entry gives — the Definition of Done is not edited at a release cut. First work of the
  window after, with the cost now measured rather than assumed.

- **WATCH: A constant's literal copies outside its reach are unheld.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:*
  `shengmo::workspace::MARKER` owns `TIANHENG_WORKSPACE_TESTS`, and seven sites in `tianheng`, `louke` and
  `xuanji` spell it as a literal because those crates cannot depend on `shengmo` without closing a cycle.
  `one_spelling`'s own module documentation puts them outside its subject, and that is right about the
  repair — they are not sites anyone declined to converge. It does not follow that they are unobservable:
  **`kanhe` sees both the constant and their text**, so a comparison is available where a convergence is not.
  *Observation source:* measured in the 0.5.0 window — one `pub const`, seven literals, nothing comparing them.
  *Current reaction or bound:* none; `one_spelling` states the exclusion and gives its reason.
  *Risk:* a mistyped literal makes its guard's skip condition permanently true, so the test silently stops
  running — a false negative, which is the one bug this project's Core Contract forbids, in the direction
  nothing is watching. *Promotion trigger:* a second constant acquiring out-of-reach literal copies, or one
  instance of the mistype. **Not fired, and reclassified `WATCH` -> `READY-PATCH` on what the check found
  instead.** Swept 2026-09-06: every spelling of `TIANHENG_WORKSPACE_TESTS` in `crates/` is exact, and the
  near-miss sweep over `TIANHENG[_A-Z]*` returns only distinct, legitimate names — no mistype. But the
  repository holds a **second** `pub const` of this shape, `kanhe::verdict_channel::ENV`, whose out-of-reach
  copies are the two shell wrappers, which cannot depend on a Rust crate at all. Its copies are **held**:
  `gate_exit_classes` asserts each wrapper's text contains `{verdict_channel::ENV}=$verdict_file`.

  So the trigger asked for a second **unheld** constant and what exists is a second constant that is held —
  by *the comparison this entry proposes, verbatim*: `kanhe` sees both the constant and their text, so a
  comparison is available where a convergence is not. **The Shape is no longer a hypothesis; it has been run
  in this tree and works.** That is what moves the class, by this file's own definitions: `WATCH` is for
  pressure without enough correctness evidence, and the evidence is the sibling. What remains is the work,
  which is what `READY-PATCH` classifies. *Version class:* patch; test scaffolding only. *Authority:*
  `repository-checks`.
  *Shape:* a direction in `kanhe` asserting every literal spelling of the token equals the constant, with a
  non-empty assertion over the set so a rename cannot empty it into a vacuous pass. Filed rather than built
  because it widens a check whose stated corpus was chosen deliberately, and changing that is a decision
  rather than a repair.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01, and the obvious instrument could not have answered it.** Grepping for the
  token's own spelling finds only correct copies by construction and can never see a mistype, which is the
  half this trigger watches. The sweep instead enumerated **every** environment-variable name literal in
  tracked Rust and compared the set: the marker's spelling is the only member of its neighbourhood, appears
  in each of the reaching sites identically to `shengmo::workspace::MARKER`, and no near-miss exists.
  `shengmo` still declares one other `pub const`, and it has acquired no out-of-reach copies.

- **WATCH: A backticked identifier in a live document is resolved by nothing.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed
  pressure:* `reference_integrity` resolves paths and `bound_register` resolves pinning-test names; a bare
  identifier cited in prose is resolved by no reaction. Two survived a full pre-release review and four review
  rounds in live governance text: `BACKLOG.md`'s Shape clause — the actionable half of a READY-PATCH entry —
  instructed an implementer to mirror `the_projection_discloses_every_declared_bound`, a test retired with
  `gate-shape-contract` in this same window; and a live WATCH entry named the self-law generator
  `tianheng_constitution()`, which has never existed, two files from the projection header that spells it
  correctly. Both are repaired. *Observation source:* measured on 2026-08-19 over
  `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `COOKBOOK.md`, `README.md` and `docs/`, extracting every backticked
  `snake_case` token and resolving it against every tracked path and every tracked file outside that set:
  **369 tokens, six unresolved, and all six legitimate** — four are explicitly past-tense (*since removed*,
  *is replaced by*, *was one*), one is in `docs/history/`, and one sits in an entry whose preceding line says
  it is kept for its reproduction record and names the surviving test. *Current reaction or bound:* none.
  *Risk:* a dead pointer in the actionable half of an entry sends an implementer to a name that is not there —
  and the class it belongs to is one this repository declares: *an entry that still describes the retired
  mechanism in the present tense is exactly as stale as one naming a retired term*. *Promotion trigger:* a
  third live instance, or a convention that makes the exemption decidable. **The trigger fired on
  2026-09-01, and two of the three instances were made by the `0.6.0` window that swept for them.** Re-run over every
  tracked Markdown file outside `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/history/`: 433 backticked `snake_case` tokens, 13 resolving to nothing, of which eleven are the
  legitimate forms this entry already names — past-tense (*since removed*, *was one*, *has never existed*),
  a spec's own hypothetical (`foo_thing`, `some_instant`), an anti-pattern named from outside this tree
  (`freeze_methods`, which `git log -S` shows was never in it), and one sitting under a closing paragraph
  that names the surviving test. The two that are not: `is_bare_key`, present-tense at this file's own
  line, deleted by the `0.6.0` window's `refactor(kanhe): the dependency grammar is parsed`; and
  `imports_and_rest`, pointing into a file that still exists after the reader moved to `syn`. Both are
  repaired here, and a third of the same class was found outside the Markdown corpus — a live doc comment
  in `crates/kanhe/tests/release_coherence.rs` describing `quoted_value` in the present tense, deleted by
  the same refactor. *Version class:* patch; governance
  documents only. *Authority:* `repository-checks`. *Shape:* filed rather than built, and the measurement is
  why. The token and the question are both decidable — *does this name exist in tracked code* — but every one
  of the six exemptions is a name cited **as history**, and recognizing that is prose judgement, which this
  repository has designed, measured and rejected three times. What would make it buildable is exemption by
  **declaration** — the idiom `one_spelling` already uses — requiring a retired name cited in a live document
  to carry a marker. That is a change to how entries are written, not a detector, which is why it is filed
  with its measurement rather than half-built. The probe also needs the `name()` form, which the run above
  did not match. **A second measured reason, from the 2026-09-01 re-run: the two available resolvers fail in
  opposite directions, and neither is the one this entry assumed.** Resolving a token against the *text* of
  tracked files — the instrument named above — reports 13 unresolved but reads a name that survives only in
  prose about its own deletion as resolved, which is exactly how `quoted_value` escaped. Resolving against
  *definition sites* catches that and reports 60, of which the overwhelming majority are legitimate: `std`
  methods (`split_once`, `read_dir`, `symlink_metadata`), crate names (`serde_json`, `toml_edit`), JSON field
  names a spec normatively defines (`stale_baseline`, `repair_hint`, `deny_breach`), and shell functions in
  `scripts/*.sh` (`require_ci_green`, `require_changed_files`). A backticked identifier in these documents
  names one of six kinds of thing, and no single corpus resolves all six — so the missing half is not a
  better corpus but the declaration this entry already proposes. A second constraint, measured over the remaining sixty live documents by a later review:
  **a negative requirement cites the name it forbids** — `adopter-surface`'s *the obsolete public `FindingKey`
  SHALL be removed* and *SHALL NOT promise a `Dimension`/`ObservedFact` plugin trait* — so a resolver keyed on
  the bare name refuses exactly the requirements being honoured. Recognize by position and shape, never by the
  bare token, which is `projection-register`'s own recorded lesson arriving a third time.

- **WATCH: The reason-perimeter rule is prose applied by hand, and four rounds of applying it produced eight
  corrections.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the falsifier in `constitution()`'s header — *delete
  what the clause asserts; if the boundary stays green while the clause turns false, the clause is outside* —
  was applied across four review rounds, moving two reasons (use clauses), then three (phrases about edges
  pointing **at** this crate), then three more (phrases about what **another** crate does). Eight corrections;
  no allowlist ever moved. By `AGENTS.md`'s own *a repair loop is a diagnosis, not a schedule*, that is a loop
  dominated by the third class — the code is right and a statement about it is wrong — whose stated remedy is
  to change the shape rather than add a round. The header itself now records *each pass missed a different
  shape*, and the third pass explicitly withdrew an exemption the second had written. *Observation source:*
  the one decidable subset a review proposed — *a reason naming a family crate that is neither its own target
  nor in its own allowlist* — was implemented against the current projection before being adopted, and
  measured on 2026-08-19, over the thirteen boundaries the projection then rendered, by extracting
  each section's heading, reason and allowlist and reporting every family crate named in a reason that is
  neither its target nor in its allowlist: **eight boundaries fired, every one a false positive, none a true
  one.** The figures are anchored to that run rather than kept current — the prototype was not retained, and a
  census with no producer is what this entry is about. Every hit is a legitimate
  prohibition entailed by the allowlist (繩墨's and 勘合's *no edge to 圭表, 渾儀, 漏刻 or 璇璣 can exist*,
  圭表's *must not depend on the 天衡 shell*) or a module boundary naming the crate it must resolve through.
  And it reaches only one of the three shapes the third pass moved: 天衡's *remains the outward composition
  layer* names no crate at all, and 渾儀's *quarantined* names `syn`, which **is** in its allowlist. *Current
  reaction or bound:* none. `self_law_amendment` makes a reason **change** visible — it carries the reason in
  the identity — but says nothing about whether a reason is inside its rule's perimeter. *Risk:* the
  projection teaches every agent that loads `AGENTS.self-law.md`, so a reason asserting structure the law does
  not react to is a false statement of the law, at its most widely read surface. Bounded by four passes having
  been run. *Promotion trigger:* a fifth pass finding a ninth clause, or a decidable subset whose first run
  over the projection produces a true positive. *Version class:* patch; both crates ship in no package.
  *Authority:* `governance-dogfood`. *Shape:* what would end the class is constructing the entailed half of a
  reason rather than writing it, leaving only a genuinely additional clause by hand — a design change, not a
  detector, which is why this is filed rather than half-built.

- **WATCH: A `cfg_attr` whose applied attributes this reader cannot parse drops its `#[path]` candidate
  silently.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* a review of the 0.5.0 window read
  `hunyi::syn_util::cfg_attr_path_values` and `meta_path_value`, both of which take `.ok()` on
  `parse_args_with(cfg_attr_metas)`. The direction is unsafe: the values are module `#[path]` remaps and the
  reader's own doc says every one is a candidate a cfg-blind walker must union, so a dropped candidate means
  some platform's source file is never scanned and any violation in it is a silent false negative. The sibling
  reader twelve lines away, `sole_bare_cfg_predicate`, declares the same collapse in its own doc — its `None`
  has three named causes including a parse failure — and its `None` is the conservative direction. *Observation
  source:* two independent attempts to construct a reaching input, one by the reviewer and one here, both
  failed. Measured against real rustc: bracket-delimited meta lists are rejected by rustc (`wrong meta list
  delimiters`), an unknown attribute is rejected before delimiters are reached, and every applied form rustc
  *does* accept — `unsafe(no_mangle)` in both editions, `doc = include_str!(…)`, a leading-`::` path, a
  trailing comma, a nested `cfg_attr` — parses as a `syn::Meta` and yields its candidate. Measured with the
  same probe: two `path` values in one `cfg_attr` take the **first**, and rustc warns `unused attribute` on the
  second, so this reader's `find_map` agrees with rustc rather than diverging from it. *Current reaction or
  bound:* none; `observation-bounds.md` has zero `cfg_attr` entries, and `hunyi/src/bounds.rs`'s header
  describes the family without declaring this member. *Risk:* a silent false negative in a published crate,
  the one direction this family forbids — bounded only by nobody having found an input. *Promotion trigger:*
  an input rustc accepts and `cfg_attr_metas` rejects. That input is also what the bound needs: a declared
  observation bound is pinned by a direction over its own WHEN, and an unconstructible WHEN cannot pin one,
  which is why this is filed rather than declared. *Version class:* patch; `hunyi` ships. *Authority:*
  `semantic-*` capabilities, which own the resolver's reach.

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01.** No sweep decides this: the trigger is an input rustc accepts and this
  reader rejects, and two people have tried to construct one and failed. A sweep of the tree cannot produce
  an input that does not exist in it; what would settle it is a construction, and the same construction is
  what the declared bound needs to be pinned by.

- **WATCH: The one-spelling corpus reader matches a dependency by name, not by resolved identity.** *Class:*
  WATCH. *Observed pressure:* `one_spelling.rs`'s `members_reaching` builds its edge set by comparing a
  declared dependency's name against each workspace member's **directory basename**, with no path, workspace,
  or source check. A member declaring a registry dependency that happens to be named after another member
  would gain an edge to the local crate it does not depend on. *Observation source:* measured against this
  workspace — all eight members' directory basenames equal their package names, so no edge is silently *lost*,
  which is the direction that would matter; and the eight declared no registry dependency at all, so the
  spurious-edge input did not exist here and the self-law's own allowlists (`serde_json only`, plus syn
  quarantined in one crate) refuse it before this reader would see it. *Current reaction or bound:* the check's
  two-way `assert_eq!(declared, reaching)`, which a spurious edge breaks **loudly** — the corpus can only grow
  under this defect, never shrink, so the failure direction is a false positive. *Risk:* a gate refusing a
  crate that cannot in fact reach the constant. Low, and loud. **Re-evaluated 2026-08-31, and one of the two premises above is now false.** The members *do* declare
  non-path dependencies — `serde_json` in seven of the eight, `syn` in 渾儀, and `toml_edit` in 勘合 since
  the `0.6.0` window's self-law amendment — so *the eight declare no registry dependency at all* no longer holds,
  and the allowlist it cites has grown with it. What keeps the spurious-edge input absent is not their
  absence but that **no such name matches any member's directory basename**, which is the property the
  trigger actually turns on and the one this entry should have rested on. The other premise still holds: the
  eight basenames equal their package names, re-derived the same day, so no edge is silently lost.
  *Promotion trigger:* a workspace member
  declaring a non-path dependency whose name matches another member's directory basename, or a member whose
  directory basename stops matching its package name. *Version class:* patch; the reader is repository
  machinery, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `repository-checks`.

- **WATCH: A command a document hands a reader is only checked in one shape.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:*
  The 0.5.0 window closed the class *a command a document hands a reader names a target that exists* by
  resolving `-p <package> --test <target>` pairs against `cargo metadata`, and a fifth instance survived it in
  a **second shape**: `BLESS=1 bash crates/kanhe/tests/bound_register.rs`, a path handed to `bash` whose target
  is a Rust integration test. Run as written it printed shell errors and **exited 0**, so a reader following it
  got a silent no-op. *Observation source:* a review of the window, then a sweep of `bash <path>` across
  tracked Rust and Markdown: five occurrences, of which one was live, one is a real script (`scripts/publish.sh`),
  two are deliberate fixture strings in failure matrices, and one is a fictional example path in a doc comment.
  *Current reaction or bound:* none for this shape; the pair shape is held by
  `every_command_a_document_hands_a_reader_names_a_target_that_exists`. *Risk:* a reader meets a command that
  does nothing and reports success — worse than one that fails, because the failure is silent. Bounded by the
  sweep: one instance in the tree, now repaired. **Not fired, re-swept 2026-09-06 over tracked Rust,
  Markdown and the specs.** Five `bash <path>` occurrences, and the mode of each target read from git:
  `scripts/publish.sh` is the one live command and is tracked `100755`; `crates/kanhe/tests/bound_register.rs`
  is this entry's own recorded instance; `crates/kanhe/tests/pin_bites.rs` appears only inside the
  `release-coherence` scenario **declaring** the shape it forbids; and the remaining two are untracked names
  this repository does not have — one inside a doc comment's measured shell example, one a fixture string in
  a failure matrix, and **neither is spelled here**, because `reference_integrity` refuses a reference to an
  untracked path and refused the first draft of this sentence for spelling one. A sweep about commands whose
  targets exist, caught writing a path that does not. Declaration, fixture and constructed example are the same three positional exemptions the
  relative-phrase bound already grants. *Promotion trigger:* a second live instance of this shape, or
  a third shape of the same class. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate.
  *Authority:* `repository-checks`, which owns the pair-shape requirement. *Shape:* the corpus differs from the
  pair check's — this shape appears in **Rust doc comments** as well as Markdown, and the rule is *a `bash`
  target must be a tracked file with an executable mode*, which git records. Two corpora and two rules under one
  requirement, which is why it is filed rather than folded into the existing check.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01.** The `bash <path>` shape appears in tracked Rust and Markdown a handful of
  times: one live command (`bash scripts/publish.sh`, tracked with an executable mode), this entry's own
  record of the repaired instance, a fictional example in a doc comment, and two deliberate fixture strings
  in failure matrices. No second live instance, and no third shape of the class.

- **WATCH: A private item's doc comment can be stolen by an item inserted above it, and nothing reacts.** *Class:*
  WATCH. *Observed pressure:* two in-window instances of one class, where a function was inserted between
  another's doc run and the function itself, so Rust attached the whole run to the newcomer and left the
  original undocumented. One change did it to `bare_references` (public); another did it to
  `adopter_cited_machinery` (private), where the merged run reads as one doc opening with a paragraph about a
  different function, and it survived nine days and a crate rename. *Observation source:* a review of the
  window, then `#![deny(missing_docs)]` added to `kanhe` and `shengmo` — the last two crates without it —
  which produced 45 and 2 undocumented public items respectively, all now documented. *Current reaction or
  bound:* `deny(missing_docs)`, in every crate, catches the **public** half: any item inserted between a doc
  and its item leaves the original with zero docs, whichever of the two carries a doc of its own — measured by
  reproducing that exact shape, which the lint refuses naming the victim. It does not reach private
  items. *Risk:* a doc describes the wrong function while reading as though it describes the right one, which
  is worse than an absent doc; a reader is actively misled. *Version class:* patch; both crates ship in no
  package. *Authority:* none — this is a lint policy, not a Tianheng boundary or a repository check.

  **The trigger fired, and the decision was re-taken on a measurement rather than on the count.** A third
  instance arrived on 2026-08-18 — `imports_and_rest`, then in `crates/kanhe/tests/refusal_register.rs`,
  private, in a test binary, after this entry (the name went with the reader's move to `syn` and no longer
  resolves) — satisfying both halves of the trigger this entry had written down:
  *a third instance, or any instance on a private item after this entry*. The reason recorded here for not
  adopting the lint was bound to the count (*a class with two instances*), so the count moving obliged a
  re-decision rather than a restatement.

  Re-decided: **still not adopted**, and now for a measured reason instead of a claimed one.
  `clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items` over `kanhe` alone reports undocumented private items across its
  library and test binaries in the thousands-of-items order — the command is written here rather than its
  answer, because the answer moves with every private item added. The lint is the only mechanism
  that closes the private half, and it closes it by demanding a doc on every private item; that cost is not
  proportionate to a class whose instances are individually cheap to repair and whose damage is a misleading
  doc rather than a wrong verdict. *Promotion trigger,* restated so it does not rest on a count nothing
  produces: an instance where the stolen doc changed what a reader **did**, rather than what they would have
  read — a repair made against the wrong function, or a bound declared from a doc describing something else.

  **Evaluated 2026-09-06: the restated trigger did not fire, and the premise for restating it did.** No
  stolen doc changed what a reader **did** in `0.6.0`. But the trigger was moved off a count on the ground
  that it was *a count nothing produces*, and `0.6.0` produced two more instances of the class: a paragraph
  describing `declared_dependencies` sitting above the helper it was not about, and `run`'s extraction
  history opening `run_exact`'s doc — the second caught only because a delegation would have made it worse
  rather than better. Both were found by review and repaired in the window that made them. So the count is
  produced; what nothing produces is a **reaction** that produces it, and those are different sentences. The
  restated trigger stands, because *a repair made against the wrong function* remains the thing worth
  promoting on, but the reason recorded for restating it is corrected here rather than left to read as
  measured.

  **What this entry could not do for itself.** Its trigger was written, both halves fired, and the entry sat
  unchanged for a full round of review — because nothing evaluates a promotion trigger. A `WATCH` is carried
  by whoever next reads it, which is the same shape as a requirement whose clause has no reaction, and it is
  the way this class of entry fails. It was caught by a review arriving at it sideways from an unrelated
  finding.

- **WATCH: A reader's corpus can be narrower than the requirement it serves, and this repository's own dimensions
  cannot see the shape.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the dominant class of the 0.5.0 window. Live
  instances repaired here: `marks_a_bound` gated pinning-citation resolution so the citations under ordinary
  scenario headings were never validated; `machinery_names` enumerated none of the workspace members against
  its own subject; the root
  manifest's `exclude` named one fixture root of two while `.gitignore` named both. *Observation source:* a
  sweep of the window's findings, then the classification in `AGENTS.md`'s *A reader reads its whole subject*,
  which separates four shapes and closes three of them by construction. **This entry counts only the fourth**
  — corpus narrower than the claim. Lossy selection, lossy acceptance and lossy accumulation are closed where
  they occur (`kanhe::selection`, `capability_subjects::Declared`, and widening the binding), so counting them
  here would fire this trigger on instances that are already shut. *Current reaction or bound:* none, and it
  is not available. `inline-symbol-path-confinement` declares that a **receiver-method read is not observed**
  — no type inference on the receiver, pinned by `inline_receiver_method_read_is_a_bound` — and
  `text.split_once(…)`, `iter.next()` and `vec.first()` are receiver-method calls, so the shape sits outside
  the observation surface this repository ships. That is an existing declared bound with an owner, not a
  rationale invented for this entry. *Risk:* a check reports clean over a subject it never read, which is the
  one direction the Core Contract forbids, and it is invisible until a second instance exists. *Promotion
  trigger:* a third live instance of the fourth shape after this entry. *Version class:* patch;
  repository-internal. *Authority:* `repository-checks`. *Shape:* only a set comparison in both directions
  catches it, and there is nothing to compare against until someone states what the subject is — which is why
  the capability-subject declarations exist and why widening them is the likely form of any repair.
  Until there is a reaction, the interim instrument is the class-directed sweep stated in `AGENTS.md` — run
  it at each pre-release review rather than trusting that the next instance will be noticed. It is what found
  the release-coherence pair after five linear rounds had read past them.

  One residue belongs here rather than to the shapes that closed. `kanhe::selection` binds only the call sites
  that use it, and nothing enumerates the readers that should. (A second residue recorded alongside this one —
  `census::figures_in` reading only the first match on a line — was closed the following day and is no longer
  live; this entry went uncorrected until a later adversarial-review pass noticed the drift.)

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01.** No sweep decides this: the fourth shape is recognised by a reader
  holding a check's corpus against the claim it serves, which this entry records as sitting outside the
  observation surface this repository ships. What would settle it is a third instance **named in a review**,
  written down when it is found rather than counted later.

- **WATCH: `Bind a claim to its measurement` is a governing rule with no reaction.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed
  pressure:* nine review rounds in the 0.5.0 window, whose largest class by far was *the corpus was wrong or
  its narrowing was undeclared* — nine of roughly twenty findings. The rule was written from that sweep and
  names three bindings: derive it, declare it and hold it both ways, or compare it after the fact where the
  carrier is text. *Observation source:* the sweep itself, plus the refutation inside it — `WRAPPERS` was
  proposed as a derivation candidate and `self_governance`'s own comment defeated it, because removing
  `guibiao` from that literal left a `guibiao` allowlist naming `hunyi` green. *Current reaction or bound:*
  the **text branch** is enforced by `crates/kanhe/tests/census.rs`; the rule above it is enforced by nothing.
  *Risk:* bounded and of a particular kind — the rule tells an author which instrument to reach for, so its
  failure mode is a check built with the weak binding where the strong one was available, which is a defect a
  reviewer finds rather than one that ships. Every instance found so far was found that way. *Promotion
  trigger:* an instance where the wrong binding was chosen **after** this rule was written — the rule being
  the control, so the nine that produced it cannot stand as evidence for themselves. *Version class:* patch;
  repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `repository-checks`, which owns the shape of a
  check. *Shape:* not a prose detector — answering it needs to know that a value is a claim *about* something,
  which is intent rather than shape, and the measured-and-rejected class here is exactly judgements over text.
  If it is ever reacted, the reaction is more likely to be a **type** that makes the weak binding harder to
  reach than a scan that recognises it.

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01, and deliberately so.** The rule is its own control: only an instance
  where the weak binding was chosen **after** the rule was written counts, so nothing in the tree today can
  answer it and no sweep ever will. It is settled by a reviewer noting, at the moment they find one, that
  the rule existed and was not reached for.

- **WATCH: a figure a repository check already produces can be repeated in prose that declares no census, and
  the join between producers and repetitions has never been taken.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the
  0.5.0 window, where adversarial review found figures wrong across a single change in every kind of place one
  can live — `crates/kanhe/tests/census.rs` records how many — and the review after it, which found a figure
  warranting a design decision written unanchored in live source. Both were found by a reader asking; nothing observed either.
  *Observation source:* the declared census set is enumerable, and so is the set of checks that produce a
  figure — several print one in a refusal or on a clean run. Neither side has been held against the other, and
  the reachable subset is exactly the figures whose producer exists and never declared them. *Current reaction
  or bound:* the declared censuses are held by `crates/kanhe/tests/census.rs`; everything outside them is the
  declared bound
  `repository-checks/a-count-written-in-a-sentence-no-census-declares-a-stated-bound`, under-reacting and
  engine-owned, with `AGENTS.md`'s three-state disposal as the reviewer's half. *Risk:* bounded, and the
  bound is what makes it a WATCH rather than a patch — a repeated figure misleads a reader and is repaired in
  a clause, and the subset a producer could close is the only part closable by construction at all. *Promotion
  trigger:* a count finding in a window after the disposal rule was written, the rule being the control —
  the same form the `Bind a claim to its measurement` entry states for its own, and for the same reason: the
  instances that produced a rule cannot stand as evidence for it. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal,
  shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `repository-checks`, which owns the shape of a check. *Shape:* enumerate
  the **producers**, never the prose. A sweep over the digits in tracked documents fails the audit cycle's own
  second test — *is this figure a census* cannot be generated and staleness-checked, only hand-maintained, so
  such a sweep would produce the drifting artifact it exists to police, one level up. The checks are code and
  therefore enumerable. Its size is deliberately not written here.

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01, for the same reason as the entry above and stated there:** the disposal
  rule is the control, so the instances that produced it cannot stand as evidence for it, and only a count
  finding made after it was written counts. The producers are enumerable; the *finding* is not.

- **WATCH: A third hand-written scanner of the `#### Scenario:`/`- **PINNED-BY**` grammar still disagrees with the
  other two on two edge cases.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* `bound_register_parse::bounds_in` and
  `bound_register_parse::citations_in` (the latter extracted from `pinning_citations` during an adversarial
  review the 0.5.0 window, so `pin_bites::cited_bounds` and `pinning_citations` share one recognizer instead of
  two) now agree with each other exactly. `crates/kanhe/tests/observation_bound_model.rs`'s own
  `spec_bounds`/`spec_defence` were not touched by that extraction and remain a **third**, independent
  implementation of the identical grammar, found by the same review to have already drifted from the other
  two in two ways: it requires a literal trailing space after `"#### Scenario:"` (`bounds_in`/`citations_in`
  trim the heading instead, so `"#### Scenario:Foo"` with no space is a bound to them and not to this
  scanner), and it checks an **untrimmed** line for a closing `"###"`/`"##"` heading (`bounds_in`/
  `citations_in` check the trimmed line, so an indented closing heading ends a bound's scope for them and not
  for this scanner). *Observation source:* the adversarial review's cross-file tracer, verified by grepping
  every tracked spec for both shapes — none currently has a `"Scenario:"` with no following space or an
  indented `"###"`/`"##"` heading, so both disagreements are latent. *Current reaction or bound:* none;
  `observation_bound_model.rs`'s bijection tests only compare its own scanner's output against
  `observation_bounds()`, which cannot see a disagreement with `bounds_in`/`citations_in` since nothing
  compares the three against each other. *Risk:* a future spec edit hitting either latent shape would have
  `observation_bound_model.rs` and the register disagree on a bound's existence or a citation's defended id,
  each internally consistent and both wrong relative to the other. *Promotion trigger:* either latent shape
  appearing in a tracked spec, or a fourth independent scanner of this grammar appearing anywhere in the
  crate. **Not fired, measured 2026-09-06** by counting the files that `starts_with` or `strip_prefix` the
  markers themselves rather than the files mentioning them: **three** — `bound_register_parse.rs`, which
  owns the grammar, and the two readers this entry already names. Counting files that merely carry the
  tokens, in prose or in fixtures, would have answered seven, and the difference between those two numbers
  is the whole of what this entry watches. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* none declared yet —
  the three readers currently agree on every live spec, so nothing has been violated to anchor one. *Shape:*
  closing this fully needs one shared low-level walker (`"#### Scenario:"`-untrimmed to open,
  `"#### "`/`"### "`/`"## "`-trimmed to close, matching `bounds_in`'s own rules) that all three call sites use,
  not a third point patch; filed rather than done here because it touches `observation_bound_model.rs`'s core
  logic, a file the 0.5.0 window's fixes did not otherwise touch, and reworking it deserves its own scoped review
  rather than folding into an adversarial-review pass over a different fix.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01, and the first instrument matched prose rather than headings.** Searching for
  the shape anywhere on a line finds this file and the changelog quoting it; anchoring the search to heading
  position finds none. Both latent shapes are still absent from every tracked spec — no `#### Scenario:`
  without its following space, and no indented closing heading. No fourth scanner either: `bound_register.rs`
  and `pin_bites.rs` both call the shared reader, and their `Scenario:` occurrences are fixture strings and
  doc prose. The third scanner survives with both divergences intact — `observation_bound_model.rs`'s
  `spec_bounds` still opens on a literal trailing space and still tests an untrimmed line for its closing
  heading.

- **WATCH: `negates_bound_in_prose`'s one-interposed-word budget is measured from `a`/`an`, independently of
  `states_a_bound_in_prose`'s own budget measured from `stated`/`documented`, so a sentence stacking both
  qualifiers is read as a declaration rather than the denial it is.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* an
  adversarial review of the 0.5.0 window's own fix (which corrected a live case-sensitivity gap in both functions,
  see the `CHANGELOG.md` entry) also asked whether the two functions' independent one-word tolerances could
  ever disagree, and found they can: `"this is not a documented residual bound"` has `states_a_bound_in_prose`
  return `true` (one interposed word, `residual`, between `documented` and `bound`) and
  `negates_bound_in_prose` return `false` (its own one-word budget, between `a` and `bound`, is already spent
  on `documented`, leaving no room for `residual` before `bound`) — so `undeclared_prose_offences`'s
  `!states(...) || negates(...)` guard evaluates `false`, and a genuinely negated sentence is reported as an
  undeclared bound. *Observation source:* verified directly (`states_a_bound_in_prose` returns `true`,
  `negates_bound_in_prose` returns `false` for the sentence above), then grepped every tracked spec for
  `(not|never) a (stated|documented) [a-z-]+ bounds?` — zero matches, so this is latent. *Current reaction or
  bound:* none. *Risk:* a future spec sentence combining a negation with a states-side qualifier
  (`"...is not a documented residual bound"`) would be misreported as an undeclared bound rather than
  correctly exempted as a denial. *Promotion trigger:* a live instance of the stacked shape in a tracked spec.
  *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:*
  `observation-bound-register`'s "A bound stated in prose but not declared as a scenario SHALL fail" — the
  requirement this pair jointly enforces. *Shape:* the two budgets need to share one accounting (e.g. count
  every interposed word from the negator through to `bound`/`bounds`, capped at two total: one for the
  negator's own qualifier, one for the states-side qualifier) rather than each independently assuming it owns
  the only interposed word in the sentence — a design question, not a one-line patch, which is why it is
  filed rather than widened here under time pressure.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01.** The stacked shape appears nowhere in a tracked spec, which is this pair's
  corpus; the matches are this file and the changelog quoting the example sentence.

- **WATCH: `requirement_heading_is_bounds_named` matches `bound`/`bounds` as a bare substring with no check on the
  character *before* the match, so an unrelated word like `Outbound`/`Rebound`/`Unbounded` in a requirement
  heading would falsely exempt that requirement from the undeclared-prose check.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed
  pressure:* the same adversarial review, independently reported by two finders. The function checks only that
  the character *after* `bound(s)` is non-alphabetic (so `boundary`/`boundaries` are correctly excluded), with
  no symmetric check on the character before — unlike this file's own `contains_words`, used by
  [`marks_a_bound`], which checks both sides. *Observation source:* traced by hand
  (`requirement_heading_is_bounds_named("Outbound Requests")` returns `true`: `"bound"` matches inside
  `"outbound"`, and the character following it — a space, from `" requests"` — reads as "no letter follows"),
  then grepped every tracked `### Requirement:` heading for a `bound`-containing word that is not
  `bound(s)`/`boundary/boundaries` itself — none found, so latent. **Not fired** (evaluated 2026-08-31; still
  none in a `### Requirement:` heading, which is the only corpus that reaches this reader — but the
  vocabulary is now in the tree: `Inbound` and `Outbound` appear in `#### Scenario:` headings, so a
  requirement heading using one is a rename away rather than hypothetical). *Current reaction or bound:* none.
  *Risk:* a requirement heading using an ordinary English word containing `bound` as a substring
  (`outbound`, `rebound`, `abound`) would be wrongly classified as bounds-named, exempting real
  bound-stating prose beneath it from `undeclared_prose_offences` and instead charging that requirement with
  "declares no bound scenario of its own" — the wrong failure mode for a heading that was never about bounds
  at all. *Promotion trigger:* a live instance of such a heading in a tracked spec. *Version class:* patch;
  repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `observation-bound-register`, the same requirement
  the sibling entry above cites. *Shape:* add the same before-the-match boundary check `contains_words`
  already has, most simply by having this function call `contains_words(heading, "bound")` /
  `contains_words(heading, "bounds")` (or a variant tolerant of the `boundary` exemption) instead of its own
  one-sided scan — a smaller change than the sibling entry above, filed alongside it rather than folded into
  the 0.5.0 window's fix because both were found by the same pass and neither has a live instance forcing it.



- **WATCH: the family-coverage reaction credits ownership by type NAME, so a profile is invisible to it.**
  *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* a profile constructs its boundaries internally —
  `Constitution::sans_io_pure` builds a `ModuleBoundary` and an `AsyncExposureBoundary` from one
  `SansIoPure` — so a file declaring a family that way never spells the type, and
  `crates/shengmo/tests/family_coverage.rs` does not credit it. *Observation source:* found while checking a
  claim this review had already written down and been wrong about. `examples/sans-io-pure` declares async
  exposure in its `src/governance.rs` through the profile and is credited only because its
  `tests/reaction.rs` separately names `AsyncExposureBoundary` outright; reading `sans_io.rs` rather than
  grepping for the type is what showed it. **Measured, not argued:** renaming that one type in
  `tests/reaction.rs` makes the reaction report `["AsyncExposureBoundary"]` unowned while
  `src/governance.rs` still declares it through the profile. *Current reaction or bound:* none — the residual is stated in the
  reaction's own module documentation rather than left for a reader to rediscover. *Risk:* a **false
  refusal**, which is the direction that costs most here: delete one line of that test and a family reads as
  unowned while the example still teaches it, sending someone to write coverage that already exists. Bounded
  today — every family has an owner that spells its type. *Why not simply widen the reader:* the honest
  closure is not a longer name list but asking what a profile *expands to*, which means evaluating
  constructor bodies rather than reading declarations — a different instrument from the one this reaction
  is. *Promotion trigger:* a family whose only adopter-shaped owner declares it through a profile, or a
  second profile reaching a family no bare declaration names. **Not fired** (evaluated 2026-08-31; `examples/`
  moved 32 times since the last evaluation, and `sans-io-pure` still declares through the one profile with no
  bare boundary beside it — neither a second profile nor a family owned only that way). *Version class:* patch;
  repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `governance-dogfood`.

- **WATCH: the capability-subject filing join observes nothing under the declared OpenSpec mode.** *Class:*
  WATCH. *Observed pressure:* `capability_subjects.rs`'s
  `a_change_names_every_capability_whose_subject_it_touches` enumerates `openspec/changes/*/proposal.md` and
  returns early when that is empty. `PROJECT.md` records this project using OpenSpec's `specs` half and not
  its `changes` half, so the corpus is empty by declaration and the early return is always taken.
  *Observation source:* `git ls-files openspec/changes` returns one path, `archive/.gitkeep`; the join was
  built in the same window the mode was declared, four commits apart, and neither noticed the other. Three
  sibling `openspec/changes/` carve-outs are in the same position — `law_restatement.rs`'s projection filter
  and two in `reference_integrity.rs` — though one of those is exercised by a fixture that plants a
  synthetic change path, so it is a branch with no live subject rather than dead code. *Current reaction or
  bound:* none for the class it guarded. **The filing class is defended by review alone**, and it is live
  rather than hypothetical: `scripts/publish.sh` has two claimants, which is the shape the join was built
  from. *Risk:* a requirement filed under the wrong capability goes unnoticed until someone reads both
  specs. Bounded — the mistake is visible in the diff of any PR that makes it. *Why not re-point it:* the
  join compares a proposal's **declared** capability set against the subjects a diff touches, and where no
  proposal is present there is no independent declaration to compare against — reading the set from the
  touched spec paths is near-tautological, since touching a spec is naming its capability. *Promotion
  trigger:* a requirement found filed under the wrong capability. **Not fired** (evaluated 2026-08-31; the filing join
  passes, and the scenarios the `0.6.0` window rewrote stayed under the capabilities that already held them).
  *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `capability-subjects`, and
  `PROJECT.md`'s adoption-mode decision.

  *Note, 2026-08-21: the trigger's second half — `the changes half being adopted, which makes the join start
  working with no edit` — is retired, because it had already happened. A change directory is committed on the
  development branch, so the join runs there and returns early only on the release spine. What stays live is
  the first half: the filing class is defended by review wherever the join returns early, which is every CI
  run.*

- **WATCH: nine structural findings the merged-review campaign deliberately did not take.** *Observed
  pressure:* a contributed review's Gate 4 found twelve functions long or deeply nested enough to hide more
  than one responsibility. Two were taken (`offences_in`'s four resolution rules, `judge`'s six phases) and
  ten were not. *Observation source:* that review, measured against `HEAD` — every length it reported was
  reproduced exactly. The residual sites are `publish_source_gate`'s `judge` and `verify_tag_signature`,
  `release_coherence_gate`'s `machinery_names`, `bound_register_parse`'s `bounds_in` and
  `undeclared_prose_offences`, `census`'s `number_at` and `sweep`, `region`'s `Prose::lines`,
  `reference_integrity`'s link normalisation. *Current
  reaction or bound:* none, and none is wanted — length is not a property this repository reacts to.
  *Risk:* low and legible. These are pure structural changes to gate code that stabilised inside the window
  that found them, and the risk of moving it is not symmetric with the risk of leaving it long. *Promotion
  trigger:* a defect found in one of the named sites whose diagnosis was made harder by its length — not the
  length itself, which is the measurement that already exists and is not the evidence. **Not fired** (evaluated
  2026-08-31; the named sites were worked in heavily and *shrank* — `release_coherence_gate.rs` 2,809 to 2,184
  lines, `manifest.rs` 820 to 637 — and no defect's diagnosis was made harder by their length).
  *One of the twelve left this list on its own evidence, not on the trigger:*
  `examples/observer-participant`'s `observe` was split, because a second review pointed out that
  `COOKBOOK.md` sends adopters to it as the runnable version of its recipe — so a design whose layers cannot
  be tested apart is being *taught*, which is an adopter-facing consequence rather than the internal
  maintainability cost the other nine carry. The trigger stays as written for those nine; what moved this one
  was a different kind of argument, not a lower bar. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal.
  *Authority:* the campaign recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`'s `### Self-governance` section.

- **WATCH: the reference gate's dated-section exemption is widest while the section is still being
  written.** *Observed pressure:* the exemption keys on a section being *dated*, and dating is the freeze
  act — `chore(release): prepare X.Y.Z` cuts `[Unreleased]` into `## [X.Y.Z] - DATE`, after which
  `release-coherence` **requires** `[Unreleased]` to be empty in the release-ready state. So from the prepare
  commit until the release, every new CHANGELOG entry is written into a dated section
  `crates/kanhe/tests/reference_integrity.rs` skips, and that section is the largest and newest in the file.
  *Observation source:* the `[0.5.0]` section, read through by hand on 2026-08-16 — every in-repository
  reference it carried, in both the prefixed-path and bare-basename forms, **resolved**. The section has grown
  since and the figures would have moved with it, so what is written down is the property and the date. So
  the exposure is real and has cost nothing yet. *Current reaction or bound:* none for that window; the
  reasoning is recorded beside the `in_dated_section` skip rather than left for a reader to rediscover.
  *Risk:* bounded and self-limiting — a stale path written into the current version's section survives only
  until someone reads it, and the same paths are usually named in the code the entry describes, which the
  gate does read. *Why not simply narrow it:* making the current version an exception means this scan asking
  `release-coherence` which version is unreleased, so a reference verdict would begin to depend on the
  release spine and a shallow checkout would move it — trading a bounded blind spot for a verdict that
  varies with checkout depth. *Promotion trigger:* a stale reference found inside the section of a version
  **not yet released** — the 41 above are the control and cannot stand as evidence for themselves. **Not
  fired.** *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:*
  `openspec/specs/reference-integrity/spec.md`.

- **WATCH: `PROJECT.md` restates facts a generated projection already holds, and states others nothing
  holds.** *Observed pressure:* three consecutive attempts at one paragraph were withdrawn, all failing the
  same way — asserting a location or an absence without sweeping for it. Classifying that file's claims
  against the generated projections splits them in two. The **architectural** ones are already carried:
  which crates exist, what each may depend on, that no dimension names a sibling — all projected from
  `shengmo::law::constitution()` into `AGENTS.self-law.md` and staleness-checked, and since
  `mutual-independence-reacts-to-membership` the last of those is asserted rather than merely projected.
  Two classes are carried by nothing: a **location** claim, the class that falsified the second attempt, and
  a **count**. *Observation source:* that classification, run against the projections and the file on
  2026-08-08. Not a census — the named instances are examples found by sampling claim-shaped lines, not an
  enumeration. *Current reaction or bound:* half of one. `crates/kanhe/tests/reference_integrity.rs` holds that a cited
  path **exists and is tracked**; nothing holds that the thing described lives there, which is the half the
  withdrawn attempt got wrong. *Risk:* the class that produced three withdrawn attempts, in the document
  `AGENTS.md` names as the contract — and it **grew** when the paragraph finally landed:
  `three-offices-are-vocabulary-not-crates` added five location claims to that file
  (`crates/guibiao/src/projection.rs`, `crates/tianheng/src/runner/render.rs`,
  `crates/xuanji/src/baseline.rs`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `crates/tianheng/src/constitution.rs`), each
  path-checked and none content-checked. Filing this entry as a smaller problem than before would have been
  the comfortable reading and the false one. *Promotion trigger:* a claim in `PROJECT.md` about the tree
  found false **after** this entry — the three found before it are the control and cannot stand as evidence
  for themselves. **FIRED 2026-09-06, on a claim this file's own next line contradicts.** `PROJECT.md`'s
  `xingbiao` crate description read *the static and semantic dimensions read the workspace through one source
  of truth* — two dimensions, where all three carry it. **The falsifier is `AGENTS.self-law.md`**, which
  renders each dimension's dependency rule from the declaration and is staleness-checked, so the membership
  is read there rather than restated here; what the projection does not carry is that 漏刻 reaches it through
  a cargo feature rather than an unconditional dependency, and **`PROJECT.md`'s own runtime-identity decision
  already records that feature by name**. So the document disagreed with itself, and the falsifier was on the
  same page rather than in the tree. Found by re-reading the file after `xingbiao`'s module doc was corrected for the identical
  omission in the same window — one carrier repaired, this one not swept, which is the retirement-sweep class
  whose corpus is *every tracked live file*. Repaired to name all three and the face 漏刻 reaches it through.
  The parenthesised function list went with it: enumerating three exports of a substrate that now holds path
  identity and the filesystem-answer policy is the same defect one level down. (Prior evaluation 2026-08-31,
  not fired; its two decidable graph claims were re-derived and hold — `xuanji` and `xingbiao` depend on no
  workspace member, and all three dimensions depend on `xuanji`.) *Version class:* not release-affecting. *Authority:* `projection-register`,
  which already enumerates the documents a claim could cite, and `self-law-projection`, which owns the one
  carrying the architecture. *Shape, if it fires:* not a detector over prose — that instrument was measured
  three times and rejected. The reachable direction is to make more of what the file asserts **citable**, so
  that restating is the strictly worse-looking option at the moment of writing.

- **WATCH: four limits of the mutual-independence check, each measured; three still declared, one closed and
  retired.** *Observed
  pressure:* closing the membership half of `三儀 ⊥ 三儀` exposed four more, all reproduced by writing them into
  the tree rather than argued about. **Wording, false refusal:** paraphrasing `guibiao`'s clause makes the
  check fire — it refuses a reason that genuinely states the law. **Wording, false negative:** a `because`
  carrying the literal clause while *negating* it passes, and `AGENTS.self-law.md` then teaches the negation to
  every agent that loads it. **Enumeration, the dimension list:** *closed, and its declared bound retired* — the
  literal is held against the workspace's own dimension crates, read from cargo and compared both ways, so the
  omission that left a `guibiao` allowlist naming `hunyi` green is refused. The bound was retired against a run
  of its own WHEN on the post-change tree rather than against the argument that it should be. It is retained
  here as the third of the four because the entry's own point is that these are one check's limits, and a
  closed one is what tells a reader the others are not.
  **Enumeration, the rule variant:** the filter admits only `RestrictDependenciesTo`, so a second
  boundary using `restrict_workspace_dependencies_to` — the more natural rule for this law — is never examined.
  *Observation source:* those four perturbations, run during review of
  `change/mutual-independence-reacts-to-membership`. *Current check or bound:* a check for the third, which
  closed it; none for the other three, whose statement lives in the check's doc comment and
  `self-law-projection` where a reader meets them. *Risk:* the second is
  the serious one — the agent-facing projection can teach the negation of the law it quotes. *Promotion
  trigger:* fired for the second; the others are recorded with it because they are one check's limits and
  closing them separately would re-open the same file four times. *Version class:* patch; a `tests/` check of
  this repository. *Authority:* `self-law-projection`. *Shape:* **pinning** any of them needs the check run over a
  supplied declaration rather than its predicate over a string, which means factoring the assertion loop to take
  a `Constitution` — that is what this entry owns. **Declaring** them needed none of that, and an earlier draft
  of this entry said it did: it read the pin requirement as a declaration requirement and withheld all four,
  which kept a measured false negative out of the register a reader is told to consult before calling a
  behaviour a defect. The three that remain are declared unpinned against this entry; the fourth's
  declaration was retired with the limit, against a run of its own WHEN rather than against the argument that
  the code now looked right.

- **ACCEPTED: capabilities whose subject is this repository are indistinguishable from those describing what
  adopters get, and nothing can tell them apart.** *Observed pressure:* the census that motivated
  `### Self-governance` found the same mispricing at a second surface. `gate-shape-contract`,
  `observation-bound-register`, `projection-register`, `self-law-projection` — and `release-coherence`, which
  review found to be a fifth — sit in the same directory, under the same lifecycle and the same review bar as
  the capabilities describing the product. Measured once, at `change/adopter-narrative-names-no-self-machinery`
  and over the **four originally identified**: 1,291 of the 8,027 non-blank lines under `openspec/specs`,
  about a sixth. Recorded as an observation of that moment rather than a live figure, since every one of those
  files changes — and since the fifth arrived while the entry was being written. *Observation source:* a keyword heuristic — per
  capability, mentions of this repository's own artifacts against mentions of adopters — and **the heuristic
  is part of the finding**. Run at `release/0.5.0` it named exactly those four. Run at this change it names
  six: `observer-protocol` sat one mention below the line either way, and `release-coherence` crossed it
  because this change added twenty-nine self-governance mentions to that spec. `release-coherence` was
  always a fifth by a plain reading of its Purpose — "the read-only repository reaction that keeps
  Tianheng's release commit spine coherent" — and the keyword count simply missed it. A set that a prose
  heuristic cannot hold steady is the instrument this repository measured three times and rejected, which is
  precisely why the set needs a marker a reaction can read. *Current reaction or bound:* none. Nothing
  distinguishes a capability whose subject is this repository from one whose subject is what ships, so
  nothing can. *Risk:* low and slow — it costs review attention and makes `openspec/specs` read as a larger
  product surface than it is; it cannot mislead an adopter, who never reads it. *Promotion trigger:* a fifth
  capability of this kind. **FIRED at filing**, by this entry's own measurement: `release-coherence` is the
  fifth, and `observer-protocol` is a sixth under one reading and not under another. Recording it as unfired
  would have been the more comfortable sentence and the false one. *Version class:* patch; specification layout of this repository. *Authority:* undecided — marking
  them is itself a governance decision about `openspec/specs`, and the change that found this deliberately
  left it alone so that change could close. *Shape:* the cheap form is a marker the register can read, so the
  distinction is enumerable rather than a convention; the expensive form is a second directory, which would
  move files every gate resolves by path.

- **WATCH: the self-governance residual is a judgement over an entry's subject.** *Observed pressure:*
  `CHANGELOG.md` is the adopter's document and offered no heading that was not an adopter's vocabulary, so
  twenty entries named that machinery, before the section was collapsed — eleven in `[Unreleased]`
  and nine in the released `[0.4.0]` — spread
  across `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed` and `### Documentation`. The rule that now refuses them reads an entry's
  **references** — a word equal to a path under `scripts/`, or to a basename `git ls-files scripts/` resolves
  — and an entry describing this repository's own governance while naming no such word stays invisible to it. *Observation source:* two live instances, not a hypothetical: after this
  window's move, the entries *The bound register refuses a restatement* and *The bound register's own citations
  can no longer read as coverage while defending nothing* both sit under adopter headings, both describe the
  bound register's own behaviour, and both name nothing the enumerator resolves. *Current reaction or bound:*
  declared unpinned as
  `release-coherence/an-entry-about-self-governance-that-names-no-machinery-a-stated-bound`; the five limits
  that *do* have a mechanical WHEN are pinned in `tests/release_coherence.rs`. *Risk:* low and
  one-directional — the adopter reads a paragraph about housekeeping, never a wrong claim about what they get.
  *Promotion trigger:* an entry of this shape carrying a claim an adopter could **act on** — a version, a
  migration step, a behaviour change — rather than a description of internals. That is a property of one
  entry and decidable by reading it, unlike a threshold on a population nothing counts. **Not fired** (evaluated
  2026-08-31; no entry written the `0.6.0` window carries a claim an adopter could act on): every
  instance found so far describes this repository's own machinery and asks nothing of a reader. *Version class:* patch; a
  document and a `scripts/` reaction of this repository. *Authority:* `release-coherence`. *Shape:* closing it
  needs a judgement over the entry's **subject** rather than its references, which is the prose detector
  `AGENTS.md` records as designed, measured three times and rejected — so the honest shape of this entry is a
  standing decision not to build it, revisited only if the trigger fires. *Risk of the alternative:* widening
  the matcher toward the subject — heading keywords, phrase lists — trades a declared, bounded blindness for an
  undeclared false-positive surface, which is the wrong direction under the Core Contract.

- **WATCH: a rejected observation point is recorded only in prose, and prose reaches no agent at the moment of
  temptation.** *Observed pressure:* rejections of whole detectors and approaches are scattered across doc
  comments, `AGENTS.md`, `BACKLOG.md` and spec prose in several non-overlapping phrasings, with nothing
  enumerating them. **No count is given, and one should not be.** Three were attempted and each was wrong within
  hours: the first stated a figure from a wider pattern set than the method it published, the second was
  falsified by this entry's own correction commit — which added two `was rejected` quotes to `BACKLOG.md`, one of
  the files any such scan reads — and every version miscounted in both directions, matching defects that merely
  describe something being dropped while missing rejections phrased another way. A grep over prose cannot census
  rejections, which is the entry's own point turned on itself. To look at the population rather than count it:
  `git grep -niE 'measured and rejected|was rejected|was dropped|would false-positive'` — one line, because a
  wrapped command's first half ran on its own and returned a silent zero. It is a starting point, not a census:
  its output includes this entry's own text and misses whatever is phrased differently. *Observation source:* reading that output, 2026-08-07, not a figure from it.
  *Current reaction or bound:* none enumerates them, though
  `docs/observation-bounds.md` shows the practice already reaching a generated projection by hand — it carries
  one refused approach with its measurement ("scanning paragraphs instead of lines … would not have caught it").
  One instance in a projection is the pattern existing without being enumerated, not the gap being closed.
  *Risk:* a rejection is re-proposed, re-measured and re-rejected; the reverse risk is equally real and is why
  this is WATCH rather than READY — see the trigger. *Promotion trigger:* **Not fired** (evaluated 2026-08-31; the candidate evidence is unchanged and still
  points both ways). The candidate evidence
  points both ways. The harness enumeration was rejected twice on an unmeasured premise, then measured at 107ms
  cold and adopted — a rejection a later reader *did* consult and correctly overturn, which argues that a
  durable, projected register would have entrenched a wrong answer twice. **Where that record now lives is the
  sharper half:** the rejection was written in the check's own comments and those comments did not survive the
  change that overturned them, so the account is here and in `CHANGELOG.md` and nowhere in the code it was about
  — which is the entry's own case for a durable record, made by the disappearance rather than by argument. The trigger is a rejection demonstrably **re-proposed and
  re-measured** by someone who could not find the record, evidenced by a tree artefact rather than by a report
  from inside the work. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:*
  `observation-bound-register`, whose spec records two rejections in this shape — "declaring once was rejected"
  and "Keying on statement similarity was rejected rather than overlooked" — so the practice is that
  capability's, while nothing carries it into an agent's context. The phrasing that names the purpose
  ("recorded as rejected rather than left to be re-proposed") is in `CHANGELOG.md`, not in a spec, which is part
  of the observation.
  *Shape, if it fires:* another instance of the enumerate → react → audit cycle beside those
  `projection-register` enumerates, not a new crate and not the separate ADR file class `AGENTS.md` forbids.
  Two constraints the survey already forces on the record type: separate the **load-bearing** reason from the
  **incidental** evidence — `AGENTS.md`'s prose-detector rejection leads with four closable false positives and
  buries the one unclosable false negative — and make strength **derived** from structural facts rather than
  authored, the way `Extent::demonstrates` is, so it cannot be self-assessed.

- **WATCH:**
- **WATCH: a pin may defend a direction its bound does not declare.** *Observed pressure:* one live instance,
  found by review rather than by any reaction — and the trigger has since fired once. A second instance was
  produced in the 0.5.0 window and removed in the round after it landed:
  `release-coherence/a-case-alias-of-a-member-directory-a-stated-bound` declared `OverReacts` and cited a
  direction that runs on Ubuntu, where the path names a directory that does not exist — so it demonstrated a
  **correct** refusal, the opposite of the reach the bound predicts. Two reviews read the same citation and
  disagreed about it, which is itself evidence for the entry: one accepted it because the direction's own doc
  states its reach, the other refused it because the register's figure counts a defence. It is unpinned now
  against this entry, so the count of live instances is one again. What the firing changes is the evidence,
  not the refusal below: an author reaches for `pinned` because a direction exists and runs, and nothing
  between the two says the direction shows what the bound predicts. `whether-a-mention-compiles-anything-is-not-observed` declares
  `UnderReacts` — the check counts a comment-only mention as named — and cited a test containing no comment at
  all, asserting instead that a substring is not a mention. That is a *reacting* distinction, so the citation
  ran, bit, and demonstrated the opposite of what the bound predicts. *Observation source:* that comparison,
  run against the declaration, its spec scenario and the cited test's body. *Current reaction or bound:*
  declared unpinned as
  `observation-bound-register/whether-a-citation-demonstrates-the-direction-its-bound-declares-a-stated-bound`;
  `Extent::demonstrates()` reaches the projection label and the contradiction classification, and nothing
  compares it with what the cited test asserts. *Risk:* the register's leading figure counts a bound as defended
  when its defence is about something else — which is the register's own failure mode, one level in. *Promotion
  trigger:* a **second** instance, or a derivation that decides the direction a test demonstrates without
  reading its source as prose. *Why not simply built:* deciding what a test demonstrates from its body is a
  judgement over code of the kind this repository has designed, measured three times and rejected over prose,
  and unlike a citation that never runs or never bites there is no reaction whose gap a fixture could exhibit —
  which is why this is declared rather than pinned. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no
  crate. *Authority:* `observation-bound-register`, and `observation-bound-model`'s sibling bound that a
  rationale contradicting its extent is accepted — the prose beside an extent was already free to disagree with
  it, and so, until this was found, was the test beneath it.
- **WATCH: a declared bound's reason is written in two carriers and nothing joins them.** *Observed pressure:*
  every declared bound states its reason twice — as the `because` of a `BoundDecl` in a `bounds.rs`, and as
  prose in the spec scenario that declares it — and `observation_bound_model` holds the two together by **id**
  only. *Observation source:* a round corrected the `because` of
  `reference-integrity/an-abbreviation-carrying-no-letter-or-no-digit-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound` to say
  that a declared under-reaction with an owner is not a *silent* false negative, and left the spec clause
  asserting that the Core Contract forbids a false refusal more strictly than a miss — the opposite of
  `PROJECT.md`. One bound's two halves contradicted each other and the id bijection saw nothing; a review found
  it by reading the spec against the contract. A per-instance `SHALL` for that one bound was then written into
  the scenario and removed again: a normative sentence that says in its own text that nothing observes it, over
  one of the bounds that carry a `because`, is prose prescription rather than a held claim. *Risk, bounded:*
  prose only, and `docs/observation-bounds.md` renders the scenario's `THEN` rather than these clauses — but the
  spec is the layer `AGENTS.md` tells an agent to read as authoritative. **That sentence named one projection
  and there are two; measured 2026-09-01, the other renders exactly these clauses.**
  `docs/observation-bound-extents.md` carries a `because` line for every declared bound, generated from the
  `bounds.rs` field, and `AGENTS.md` lists it as a contract projection in the same sentence as its sibling.
  So the second half of the trigger below has been satisfied for every bound since that projection existed —
  one more trigger standing satisfied rather than armed, the class filed above arriving a fifth time, in the
  same sweep that filed it, which says the enumeration was short rather than that the class is growing.
  *The shape:* generate the `because`
  from the spec clause so there is one carrier, or hold every bound's two carriers to each other. Both compare
  prose, which this repository has measured and rejected in the general case; the narrow form holds a *named*
  phrase rather than a similarity. **An instance measured the same day says this shape buys less than it
  reads.** The citation bound's reason was false in three hand-maintained carriers — the spec clause, the
  `because`, and that entry's own observation source — and the generated extents projection carried it into
  an agent-facing document as a fourth. Every carrier **agreed**. Joining them, or generating one from
  another, is exactly what already holds `bounds.rs` and the extents projection together, and it propagated
  the false ground rather than catching it. Agreement is not correctness, and the repair proposed here buys
  agreement; what caught that instance was a person running the entry's own trigger against the file that
  answers it. *Promotion trigger:* a second bound found with diverging carriers, or a
  bound whose reason reaches the agent-facing projection. **State, sorted 2026-09-01:** the second half is
  fired and recorded above. The first half is **witness-only** for the reason this entry gives for not
  building its own reaction — deciding whether a `because` and its spec clause say the same thing is a
  comparison of prose, so the set is enumerable but the judgement is not, and a sweep would produce the
  similarity measure this repository has measured and rejected. It is settled by a reviewer reading one
  bound's two carriers against each other and finding they disagree, as the reviewer who found the first
  one did. *Compatibility class:* patch; no crate ships either
  carrier. *Authority:* this entry.

- **WATCH: a bare reference to a registered constructor's name cannot be told from a local variable sharing
  its spelling without name resolution.** *Observed pressure:* `refusal_register.rs`'s reader moved from a
  character-by-character scan to `syn`, which closed the *lexical* half of the wider bound this entry used
  to name — a byte char literal, a raw string, a wrapped import, a two-line closure parameter list are all
  read correctly now, by construction rather than by an arm added the day each was found wrong. What a real
  parser's AST cannot supply is name resolution: `let build = violation; …; build(x)` and a reference to
  `violation` after a local binding of the same spelling has shadowed it are syntactically identical to a
  call to the constructor taken by value, and no reading of syntax alone decides which one a given file
  means. *Observation source:* `crates/kanhe/tests/fixtures/refusal_scan/a_constructor_taken_by_name.rs.txt`
  and `a_siteful_constructor_taken_by_name.rs.txt`, the two fixtures this residue is written against.
  *Risk:* a module that actually shadows a refusal constructor's name with an unrelated local would be
  over-counted as constructing one — the safe direction, since it can only report a site that does not exist
  rather than miss one that does. Bounded by the corpus, which is the whole of the bound: `kanhe` ships in
  no package, and the reader reads `crates/kanhe/src`. **The clause that used to stand here said no file in
  this repository shadows a constructor's name this way, and that was false when written.** Measured on
  2026-09-01: nine do — `let violation = …` in `guibiao`, `louke`, `xuanji`, `tianheng` and two of `kanhe`'s
  own test binaries. Every one lies outside `crates/kanhe/src`, which is why the over-count has never been
  realised and why the corpus, not the tree, is what bounds it. *Next trigger, rewritten 2026-09-01 over
  the corpus it watches:* an occurrence of the shadowing shape **inside `crates/kanhe/src`**, the only place
  the over-count can be produced. The old trigger said *this repository's own source*, and so stood
  satisfied nine times over while the residue it watches had never occurred. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the checks ship in no crate.

- **WATCH: a `Shape` clause is a hypothesis, and this file records no difference between one that has been
  run and one that has not.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* three `READY-PATCH` entries were taken to
  the tree in the `0.6.0` window and none of their proposed shapes survived contact — **and the three failed in
  three different ways, which is the finding rather than an aggregate**. *The citation half* of the
  un-reacted-`SHALL` entry proposed extending an existing pointer, and the pointer turned out to be held only
  to its name resolving: the instrument holds less than the entry assumed. *The prose-claim entry* proposed a
  declared phrase held against a produced set, and the class's instances are claims their author believed, so
  a declaration-armed mechanism cannot be armed for them: the arming cannot reach the instances. *The
  semantic-delegation entry* proposed invoking the observer at the call site, and doing it closed the two
  paths' **equality** rather than the delegation: the repair closed an adjacent property. No reaction can
  predict all three, because they are not one mechanism — which is why what is filed here is the **status of a
  shape**, not a rule about shapes being wrong. *Observation source:* those three, plus the counter-example
  that keeps the claim honest: the TOML-reader entry's shape was **right** — migrate the readers to a parser —
  and what was wrong was its subject list, naming a reader that had never read TOML and omitting the one that
  survived. A shape is not usually wrong; its status is unrecorded. *Current reaction or bound:* none, and
  none is available: whether a shape has been run is a question about this repository's history and the
  author's intent, which is the judgement-over-text class measured and rejected three times. *Risk:* a
  `Shape` clause is the actionable half of an entry, and an implementer reads one designed in the same act
  that found the defect exactly as they read one that has been attempted and revised. The cost is a window
  spent building the wrong thing, and it is paid by whoever picks the entry up rather than by whoever wrote
  it. Bounded by the shapes being prose that nothing executes. *Promotion trigger:* a fourth entry whose
  shape does not survive contact **after** this entry was written — the entry being the control, so the three
  that produced it cannot stand as evidence for themselves — or an implementer following a shape to
  completion and finding at the end that it closed nothing. *Why prose and not a field:* the convention
  already exists in one entry and cost nothing to write there. The semantic-delegation entry records its own
  failed attempt and what the attempt measured, in its own text, and that record is what stopped the next
  window from repeating it — so the form is proven and what is missing is that the other entries do not use
  it. A new field would be a form to maintain for a property one sentence carries. *Version class:* patch;
  this file ships in no crate. *Authority:* this entry, and `AGENTS.md`'s *A repair loop is a diagnosis, not
  a schedule*, which sorts a round's findings and says nothing about the status of a repair a round proposed.

- **WATCH: the release gate acquires and decides in one unit, and the review found it where isolation was
  needed.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* an external review of the `0.6.0` window filed three findings
  against one shape — `require_internal_pins`, `require_example_pins` and `machinery_names` each run cargo,
  read the filesystem, enumerate through git, parse TOML, and then decide policy inside the same function;
  and one manifest is parsed several times over, once for the package name and again for the version
  surfaces, once per side of the internal-pin comparison, and again per inherited dependency. *Observation
  source:* that review, and the two repairs made in the same round that the mixing made harder than they
  should have been — a path-separator assumption and a lossy byte decode, both of which had to be reasoned
  about through the acquisition rather than exercised against a pure derivation. *Current reaction or bound:*
  none; the gate's directions reach it end to end, which is what makes each of them expensive and none of them
  a unit. *Risk:* a policy nobody can exercise without a repository, a cargo and a git — so every question
  about normalization, encoding or ordering is answered by reading rather than by running, which is the state
  the two findings above came out of. *Promotion trigger:* a third finding whose isolation the mixing blocks,
  or a change to any of the three functions that needs a new fixture to ask a question about a pure
  derivation. *Shape:* acquire once into a typed manifest context and derive from it — the same split the
  observer protocol already draws between reading the workspace and judging it, applied one level down. What
  it is **not** is a decomposition by size: splitting a long function that still acquires and decides moves
  the mixing rather than ending it. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal. *Authority:* this entry.

- **WATCH: a gate that is its own test is outside the refusal register.** *Observed pressure:* several
  gates are implemented under `crates/kanhe/tests`, where the judgement and the directions over it share a
  file; their refusals carry no site identity, because *which direction observes this branch* has no answer
  when every direction in the file can see it. *Observation source:* the refusal register, whose corpus is
  `crates/kanhe/src` — measured when deleting the site-less constructors broke those files and not the
  registered ones. *Risk:* a refusal in one of those gates is unexercised and nothing says so, which is the
  gap the register closed everywhere else. Bounded by those files being both judgement and test, so a
  refusal with no direction over it is visible to anyone reading the file it lives in. *Next trigger:*
  moving such a judgement out of its test file, at which point it enters the corpus and is triaged like
  every other. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the checks ship in no crate.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01.** No judgement moved out of a test file into the register's corpus — the
  refusal sites in `crates/kanhe/src` fell rather than rose across the `0.6.0` window, as the parser conversions
  deleted hand-rolled readers.

- **WATCH: a promotion trigger is evaluated by whoever next reads the entry.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed
  pressure:* an entry in this document recorded a class, its instances, its risk and its own promotion
  trigger — *a third instance, or any instance on a private item after this entry* — and both halves fired
  on 2026-08-18 without anything acting on them. The entry sat unchanged through a full round of review and
  was reached sideways, from an unrelated finding, rather than by anyone asking whether it had triggered.
  *Observation source:* that miss, and then a sweep of this document run on purpose the same day: of the
  triggers phrased as a count or an instance, two already carried a recorded *not fired*, one had fired
  and was re-decided, and the rest were evaluated and had not. A third scanner of the scenario grammar is
  still three — the two further matches are fixture text and prose, read to check. A third governance member
  has not arrived. A second orphaned corpus has not: every tracked fixture corpus is referenced. A second
  ecosystem pinning by digest has not, because the one this repository cannot refresh *is* the entry's
  subject. *Risk:* an entry states the condition under which a decision must be re-taken, and the condition
  arrives silently — which is the same shape as a requirement whose clause has no reaction, one document
  over, and the only way this class of entry fails. Bounded by the entries themselves: each names its
  trigger, so the sweep is possible and cheap; what is missing is anything that runs it. **It was run a second
  time on purpose, on 2026-08-31**, thirteen days and one shipped release after the annotations were last
  evaluated — and it was the dates that made the staleness visible, which is what they were added for. All
  seven were re-evaluated against the tree rather than re-dated: none had fired. Each annotation now carries
  what was checked beside its date, because a date alone asserts an evaluation without saying what it looked
  at, which is the same shape as a figure without its instrument. *Next trigger:* a
  second trigger found to have fired unnoticed, at which point the answer is a reaction over this document
  rather than a sweep run on purpose — the same escalation the orphaned-corpus entry declares for itself.
  **That trigger is decidable only because the annotations now carry a moment.** They were written as
  present-tense assertions — a bare *not fired* — so a reader could not tell one evaluated today from one
  written when the entry was filed and unread since, and *unnoticed* had no observable meaning. Every
  annotation matching `**Not fired.**` now reads `**Not fired** (evaluated <date>)`, and a sweep compares
  dates rather than re-reading every entry. **The corpus is named because the first sweep was stated
  universally and was not**: a mechanical replacement matched only the capitalised form, so one annotation
  spelled `**not fired.**` survived a claim that every annotation carried a date. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; this document ships in no crate.

- **WATCH: a tracked declaration nothing reads.** *Observed pressure:*
  `crates/kanhe/tests/fixtures/refusal_scan/` was tracked on 2026-08-10 and referenced by nothing until
  2026-08-18 — a case corpus naming exactly what a refusal-construction reader must handle, three of whose
  cases
  were rediscovered the hard way in the meantime and one of which had not been. *Observation source:* the
  register's own reader, which the corpus was written for. *Risk:* a declaration written and then orphaned
  reads as coverage to anyone who finds it and holds nothing. Bounded by measurement: every tracked fixture
  corpus in this repository is referenced by at least one reader — eight of eight, swept the day this was
  written — so this is one instance rather than a class. **Re-swept 2026-09-06: eight tracked fixture corpora,
  every one referenced by at least one reader outside `fixtures/` — the same eight-of-eight the entry was
  written on, none added and none orphaned.** *Next trigger:* a second orphan, at which point the
  shape changes and a reaction enumerates them instead of a sweep run on purpose. **Not fired** (evaluated
  2026-08-31; `crates/kanhe/tests/fixtures/` holds `refusal_scan`, this entry's own subject and now read, and
  `pin_mutations.tsv`, which `pin_bites` reads on every run). *Authority:* engine.
  *Compatibility:* patch.

- **WATCH: a refusal reachable only by a broken tool is not observed.** *Observed pressure:* fifteen refusal
  sites are declared unheld in `crates/kanhe/src/refusal_bounds.rs` — every one of them a cannot-judge
  reachable only when a tool this repository invokes fails mid-run. *Observation source:* the refusal
  register, which measured which sites a direction observes by running rather than by reading their
  messages; five textual predicates asked the same question first and answered differently every time.
  *Risk:* one of those fifteen refuses with the wrong sentence, or the wrong exit class, and nothing says
  so. Bounded by all fifteen being cannot-judge: the class reserved for *this could not be read*, so the
  worst case is an unhelpful sentence rather than a defect reaching a release. *Next trigger:* a harness
  that can supply a failing tool without the fixture becoming a test of that harness — a recorded process
  boundary rather than a fake binary on the path. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the checks
  ship in no crate.

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01.** No sweep decides this: the trigger is a harness that can supply a
  failing tool without the fixture becoming a test of that harness — a thing someone would have to design,
  not a state of the tree. Until one exists there is nothing to look for.

- **WATCH: the window the publish wrapper can only narrow.** *Observed pressure:* the publish wrapper runs
  the source gate, then `cd`s and `exec`s `cargo publish`. Between those the repository can be altered — a
  commit, an amend, a tag moved, the remote's `main` advancing — and the gate's verdict is about the tree as
  it was. *Observation source:* a sweep for limits declared on one wrapper and not on its sibling. The merge
  wrapper declares this class for its own title and pins its other two inputs by construction; the publish
  wrapper, standing in front of the act that cannot be undone, declared nothing. *Risk:* a version is
  uploaded from a commit the gate never judged, permanently, which is the failure this whole capability
  exists to prevent. Bounded by what `cargo publish` re-checks for itself — it refuses a dirty worktree, so
  reaching this needs the tree amended *and* committed — and by the window being two statements wide rather
  than a whole `cargo test`. *Next trigger:* cargo gaining an argument that names the commit a publish must
  package, which is what closes the equivalent window on the merge path; until then narrowing is the only
  available move and it is already taken. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the wrapper ships in
  no crate.

  **Not fired, re-measured 2026-09-01 against the installed toolchain.** cargo 1.96.0 offers no argument
  naming the commit a publish must package; `--index` names a registry, not a revision.

- **WATCH: a code span shaped like an object that names none.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the
  citation reader decides by shape, so a code span carrying 4 to 40 lowercase hex characters with both a
  letter and a digit is refused whether or not it names a commit — a review planted an unrelated hex value
  and watched it refused. *Observation source:* resolving each token against the object database was measured
  and declined. **The ground given for declining was false, and the trigger below fired on it on
  2026-09-01.** It said CI checks out one commit; the job that runs this reader checks out with
  `fetch-depth: 0`, and has since `0.2.1` — three releases before this bound was declared — for a reason the
  workflow states in that job's own checkout block. Resolution is therefore decidable where the reader runs,
  in CI and in a contributor's clone alike. What actually declines it is a different property, now written
  in its place: the verdict would depend on the object store rather than on the tracked text, and the jobs
  in this workflow that check out at the default depth would answer clean over every citation, so moving the
  reader to one of them — or dropping that line for cost — would report clean for a reason unrelated to the
  content. That is a false negative produced by configuration. **The same defect afflicts the
  `git cat-file -t` instrument the own-commit-objects entry proposes as its upgrade path**, which is now one
  shared reason rather than two entries each arguing alone. Measured over the live
  corpus: no span of this shape names anything but a commit, and no span of 4 to 6 characters carries both
  kinds of character at all, so the over-reaction is unrealised. *Current reaction or bound:*
  `reference-integrity/a-code-span-shaped-like-an-object-is-refused-though-it-names-none-a-stated-bound`.
  *Risk:* prose that means to write a hex value in a code span is refused and has to reword — visible and
  fixable, which is why this direction was chosen over the miss. *Next trigger:* a real value of that shape arriving in live prose, or a CI
  checkout that carries history, which would make resolution decidable — **that second clause fired, and is
  kept rather than struck**: it was already true when the bound was declared, so it never named a future
  event, and the entry records the state instead of dropping the clause that revealed it. It is answered
  above: resolution *is* decidable, and the property that declines it is a different one. What would reopen
  the decision is a way to resolve an object that does not depend on the checkout.
  *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the reaction is repository machinery and ships in no package.

- **WATCH: an abbreviation carrying no letter or no digit.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:*
  `no_live_document_cites_a_moment_a_fresh_clone_cannot_reach` recognises an abbreviated commit object by
  shape, and requires both a letter and a digit so that it refuses neither a long run of digits written as a
  figure nor an English word spelled from the hex alphabet — both live in this tree, and both would be false
  refusals. *Observation source:* every commit object cited by live governance text when the reaction landed
  carried both kinds of character, so the reader caught all of them; the residue is what a future citation
  might look like, not what one does. Over uniformly random seven-character abbreviations the fraction
  carrying only one kind is 3.8%, computed from the alphabet rather than sampled. *Current reaction or
  bound:* `reference-integrity/an-abbreviation-carrying-no-letter-or-no-digit-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`.
  *Risk:* one citation of that shape survives in live text and reads as anchored — bounded by the reaction
  catching every other shape, so the class cannot accumulate silently the way it did before the reaction
  existed. *Next trigger:* an instance, which the sweep this entry names would find. *Authority:* engine.
  *Compatibility:* patch; the reaction is repository machinery and ships in no package.

  **Not fired, and the residue stopped being hypothetical, swept 2026-09-01.** This entry said the residue is
  what a future citation might look like rather than what one does. One does: `docs/history/`'s
  published-artifact inventory abbreviates the `0.2.2` release commit to eight characters that carry no
  letter at all, so the reader would not recognise it as a citation. Nothing is missed, because it lands in
  the record corpus the reaction exempts — but the shape is now realised in the tree rather than computed
  from the alphabet, and the trigger's *an instance* means an instance in live governance text, which is
  still zero.

- **WATCH: a relative phrase in non-record Markdown.** *Observed pressure:* `AGENTS.md` states the rule for
  prose generally — a relative anchor "names a moving reference, so it is stale the moment the window closes"
  — while `no_tracked_source_names_a_relative_anchor` reads line-comment formats only. The exclusion for
  Markdown gave two grounds and the second, *in a record a relative phrase narrates a past state*, reaches
  `CHANGELOG.md`'s dated sections and `docs/history/` but not `BACKLOG.md`, `AGENTS.md` or the
  specifications, which carry no dated sections and are read later by design. *Observation source:* a review
  named two unanchored phrases in this file; sweeping the four declared phrases across tracked non-record
  Markdown found that most of what a widened reaction would report is not an offence — `AGENTS.md`'s own row
  declaring the phrases, duration uses (*for a window* narrating how long something lasted), generated
  projections' copies of either, and phrases already anchored by naming the release. Both unanchored
  pointers were closed in the `0.5.0` window. **No count is written, here or in the bound.** The corpus and
  the command stay — a `git grep` for the declared phrases over tracked Markdown outside `CHANGELOG.md` and
  `docs/history/` — and a figure does not, because this entry, the scenario and the scenario's two
  projections each quote the phrase to name it, so any breakdown moves as it is written. Three attempts
  proved that rather than argued it: stated in the spec, moved here, and wrong in both.
  *Current reaction or bound:*
  `reference-integrity/a-relative-phrase-in-non-record-markdown-is-not-observed-a-stated-bound`; the two
  unanchored phrases are anchored to `0.5.0`. *Risk:* a phrase written here goes stale when its window
  closes and nothing says so, which is what the rule exists to prevent — bounded by this file being read by
  a person against the tree rather than executed. **The class recurred ten times in the `0.6.0` window, and the count is what changes the argument.** The
  `0.5.0` window closed the unanchored pointers to zero; re-measured later in `0.6.0`, `BACKLOG.md`
  carried ten and `AGENTS.md` one, every one of them written by the hand that had just repaired the class
  elsewhere. Nothing observed it, which is this bound, working as declared.

  **Re-measured 2026-09-06 over the same corpus, and the sweep that ran it added one.** The command answers
  five in `BACKLOG.md` and one in `AGENTS.md`, against eleven at the previous reading. The `AGENTS.md` hit is
  its own declaring row; of the five, one sits in the closed reproduction records and one is anchored by
  naming its release in the same clause, both exempt by the dispositions below — leaving **three offences**,
  down from ten. Two are `0.6.0`'s lexical and substrate entries and **one was written by the promotion-trigger
  sweep itself**, in the very repair whose subject is a figure attached to the wrong corpus. All three are
  anchored to `0.6.0` now.

  The count falling is not the interesting half. *The class is produced by the hand repairing it, again* —
  which the previous reading already recorded and which held for a second window running, and the shortest
  interval yet was minutes rather than days. Nothing observed any of it; the bound says so, and the bound is
  the only thing that did.

  *And the disposition of all thirteen occurrences is sharper than the earlier sweep suggested.* That sweep
  reported that most of what a widened reaction would see is not an offence. Counted this time: one is
  `AGENTS.md`'s own row **declaring** the phrases, two sit in the closed reproduction records this file
  already treats as a record corpus — one of those anchored by naming its release in the same clause — and
  **ten were offences**. The exemptions are positional, not semantic: a table row and a declared section,
  both of which a corpus rule can name without reading a sentence.

  *Next trigger:* a way to tell a pointer from a span that
  does not read the sentence — a declared syntax for anchoring, say, so the reaction judges a form rather
  than a meaning. **What the count above opens instead is the corpus.** The Rust-side reaction already
  refuses these four phrases and its repair is deterministic — name the release — which is the property
  `AGENTS.md` now requires of a check over authored text: a refusal whose repair the author can apply without
  judging meaning. So the phrase is not the undecidable half; the corpus is, and the corpus is a list of
  paths. Widening it to non-record Markdown, minus the declaring row and the record sections, is a decision
  rather than a discovery, and it is put here with its measurement rather than taken. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the reaction is repository machinery and
  ships in no package.

  **Witness-only, sorted 2026-09-01.** No sweep decides this: the trigger is a *declared syntax for
  anchoring* — a decision about how these documents are written, so that the reaction judges a form rather
  than a meaning. The corpus and the command are written above and stay runnable; what is missing is the
  convention, and no run produces one.

- **WATCH: the backtick primitives the pairing reader names.** *Observed pressure:* pairing markers as they
  arrive lets one unpaired marker shift every pair after it, which reads as prose named and a name dropped
  rather than as an error. `no_source_outside_the_shared_reader_pairs_backticks_by_hand` refuses `split` and
  `find` with a backtick literal outside `reading`. *Observation source:* the round that extracted
  `reading::backticked` converted the three sites a review named and left three more standing; the round
  after it added the reaction, and a review then found the reaction closed only one of the two primitives
  `reading`'s own doc names. Measured when this was written: no site outside `reading` uses either, and five
  sites use `split_once`, `strip_prefix`, `strip_suffix`, `trim_matches` or `matches` with a backtick literal
  — none of them a pairing. *Current reaction or bound:*
  `repository-checks/a-marker-is-reached-through-some-other-primitive-a-stated-bound`. *Risk:* a sequence
  paired by hand through one of those five passes, and the shifted pairing it produces is readable, so
  nothing downstream reports it either. Bounded by all five being in live use for reading one delimited value,
  where they are correct. *Next trigger:* a site using one of the five to walk a sequence — which would mean
  the primitive's name is the wrong instrument and the question is the expression's shape. *Authority:*
  engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the reaction is repository machinery and ships in no package.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01.** The five primitives appear with a backtick literal at a handful of sites,
  each reading one delimited value rather than walking a sequence. The one site inside an iterator chain was
  read whole to be sure: `projection_offences` strips a prefix and then a suffix from each line, taking one
  value per line, which is not a pairing.

- **WATCH: the always-Some consumer reached through a binding.** *Observed pressure:* `str::split` and
  `str::rsplit` always yield at least one item, so every consumer treating `.next()` as fallible is a branch
  nothing reaches. `no_branch_reads_an_always_some_value_as_if_it_could_be_absent` decides the consumer by
  what it does to the `Option` — thirteen suffixes and three enclosing constructs — on one logical line.
  *Observation source:* the round that added the reaction listed four suffixes and two constructs, and a
  review then found two live sites using a fifth and a sixth, one of them in a published crate. Widening the
  vocabulary closed those; what stays open is reach, not vocabulary. Measured when this was written: no site
  in the tree binds a `split(…).next()` and consumes it on a later statement. *Current reaction or bound:*
  `repository-checks/the-consumer-stands-on-a-later-statement-a-stated-bound`. *Risk:* a dead default written
  through a binding passes, and it reads to a later maintainer as though the empty case happens. Bounded by
  the reader joining chains `rustfmt` broke, which is where the shape usually lands. *Next trigger:* a site
  binding the value and consuming it later — following that binding is name resolution, which is the point at
  which a reader over text is the wrong instrument. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the reaction
  is repository machinery and ships in no package.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01.** No site binds a `split(…).next()` and consumes it on a later statement.
  The one candidate consumes the `Option` on the same statement it is produced, which the reader already
  sees; the other matches are a doc comment and a fixture string.

- **WATCH: the early-exit consumers the pipeline reader names.** *Observed pressure:* adopting
  `defaults.run.shell: bash -euo pipefail {0}` made a consumer that stops before its producer finishes fail
  the whole pipeline — `printf … | grep -q` measured 141 on five of five runs over a document the size of the
  SARIF fixture. `no_step_reads_a_value_through_a_pipeline_that_stops_early` refuses the shape over every
  tracked text this repository runs shell in, deciding the consumer by what its flags ask for — `head`, or a
  `grep` whose cluster carries `q` or `m`, in either order and in the long forms. *Observation source:*
  the round that adopted workflow-level strictness, which found three pipelines of this shape and measured
  each; two of them had not tripped, for a reason belonging to the input rather than to the pipeline — `cargo
  metadata` emits one line of JSON, so `sed` printed once and reached EOF. The round after it found two more,
  in both wrappers, standing in front of the two irreversible acts: measured over a 405 KB stream, 0 of 8 runs
  returned non-zero with the token at the end and 8 of 8 with it near the start, so those held by where the
  token happened to sit. *Current reaction or bound:*
  `repository-checks/a-consumer-that-stops-early-is-neither-head-nor-grep-a-stated-bound`. *Risk:* a
  pipeline whose last stage exits early under some other program's name passes, and the failure it eventually
  produces names the data rather than the shape — which is the whole reason this is refused by construction
  rather than remembered. Bounded by the corpus being three tracked files a reviewer reads whole. *Next
  trigger:* a stage reading a value through a program that exits early and is neither `head` nor `grep` —
  which would mean naming programs is the wrong instrument, and the question behind it is *does this stage
  read its input to EOF*, which no reader over shell text can answer. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; the
  reaction is repository machinery and ships in no package.

  **Not fired, swept 2026-09-01, and the first instrument counted `||` and regex alternations as pipelines.**
  Read line by line instead, the pipelines across the tracked files this repository runs shell in end in
  `jq`, which reads to EOF, and in the one `head` and the one `grep` the reaction already names. No stage
  reads a value through some other program that exits early.

- **ACCEPTED DEBT: a scenario can pin a property its requirement's prose never declares, and both
  instruments that would refuse it were priced and declined.** *Observed pressure:* `AGENTS.md` names this
  seam and says which direction is unowned — *a scenario gaining a `PINNED-BY` with no clause declaring what
  it pins*. The `0.6.0` window then walked into it three times in one class: raw-identifier scenarios were
  written into `module-boundary`, `semantic-forbidden-marker` and `semantic-signature-coupling` with no
  clause in any of the three requirements saying an attribute, a derive or a macro is the name it spells.
  A fourth spec got its clause, which is the only reason the other three were noticed.

  *Observation source:* those three requirements, measured with `grep -c` over each requirement's own prose
  block, answering zero against eleven scenario lines carrying the property. *Current reaction or bound:*
  none; the discipline is `AGENTS.md`'s sentence and a reviewer's reading, and reading is what found all
  three. *Risk:* bounded and **visible** — a requirement narrower than its scenarios is legible to anyone
  reading the two together, and every instance so far was found that way rather than reported from the
  field. What it costs is that a later reader takes the requirement as the contract and the scenarios as
  examples, and edits toward the narrower one.

  **Both instruments were built and measured in the `0.6.0` window, and both are declined.** The method is described
  rather than shipped, because a measurement script kept in-tree is stock with no owner.

  *The lexical reader* — a term appearing in two or more of a requirement's scenarios and in none of its
  prose — is unusable, and not merely noisy. Over `openspec/specs/*/spec.md` it produces thousands of
  candidate refusals, all of them scenarios legitimately using ordinary vocabulary their requirement does
  not repeat. **Every narrowing that quietens it loses the instance**: restricting to hyphenated terms, or
  to three scenarios, or to the `THEN` clause, reaches single-digit false positives and stops catching the
  known case — the same trade this repository already measured for its other prose detectors. The reason is
  under the noise: the property was written *both* `raw identifier` and `raw-identifier` inside one spec, so
  there is no canonical spelling to key on, and a reader keyed on one of them asks an author to write to the
  checker.

  *The structural reader* — a requirement gaining a scenario while its own prose block is unchanged — is
  decidable and spelling-independent, which is what made it worth measuring. Per commit it fires on roughly
  a third of all requirement-level scenario additions in this repository's history, **including every
  release snapshot**, because a squash collapses the development commit where the prose did move. Measured
  at the window level instead, which is what a branch gate would see, it fires on **27 of 107** across every
  window from `0.1.0` to this one. A quarter of all legitimate spec work, whose repair on a false positive
  is a clause the author did not need — writing to the checker rather than writing well. `PROJECT.md`
  records the rule that decides it: *never add a permanent authoring tax to close a bounded, visible
  failure*, on which three entries are already declined.

  **Unfired at filing, 2026-09-06, and this says what that rests on**: every instance of the class known to
  this repository was found by a person reading a requirement against its own scenarios, and none was
  reported from a release or an adopter. That is the state the trigger below is written to change, not a
  sweep anyone can re-run — which is why it carries no date beyond this one.

  *Next trigger:* an instance of this seam that reading does **not** find — a scenario pinning a property
  the reaction does not have, reaching a release or an adopter rather than a review. That is what would
  move the failure from bounded-and-visible to the class the tax is worth paying for. A second trigger, on
  the other side: the structural reader's window-level rate falling to near zero, which would mean the
  discipline holds by practice and the gate costs nothing to add.

  *Version class:* patch; no crate is touched either way. *Authority:* `AGENTS.md`'s seam sentence, and
  `PROJECT.md`'s authoring-tax rule.

- **ACCEPTED DEBT: `path_meta_values` answers a lexical question with a byte scanner, and a generated
  differential is what bounds it.** *Observed pressure:*
  the reader decides which positions in a `cfg_attr` span are applied module targets, and every property
  that decision rests on is lexical — where a group's predicate ends, whether a group is a `cfg_attr`'s,
  whether a segment is reached through `::`, and what one identifier is. Each is answered from bytes rather
  than from a parse, and a shape answered wrong produces a **clean** verdict over a file no build compiles.

  *Observation source:* the directions that pin the corpus as it stands, each carrying the run in which the
  reader before it answered `Clean` over such a file —
  `a_cfg_attr_predicate_is_not_an_applied_module_target`,
  `a_path_inside_a_compound_predicate_is_still_a_predicate`,
  `a_path_qualified_look_alike_is_not_cfg_attr` over the pinned qualification spellings,
  `an_unqualified_raw_cfg_attr_is_still_the_built_in`, and
  `a_doubly_nested_cfg_attr_path_is_followed_the_same_as_a_single_nesting`. What each shows is not that a
  repair happened but that the property is decidable and was decided wrongly from bytes.

  *What this is not:* an argument for a parser. 漏刻's prod face is std-light by a recorded decision;
  taking `syn` here is the amendment `PROJECT.md` refuses for 圭表 for the same reason. **This entry said
  圭表 answers the same question with a byte scanner correctly, and that was written without measuring it.**
  Measured since: 圭表's own collector carried the qualified-path family — over
  `(any(), foo::cfg_attr(a, path = "bogus"), path = "real.rs")` it yielded two positions where one is
  right, and the raw spelling the same — while its `depth == 1` guard happened to close the compound
  predicate that defeated 漏刻. Neither reader is the correct one: each hand-rolls the same lexical
  decisions and each misses a different subset, which is the pressure this entry records rather than a
  property of either. *Risk:* a wrong answer is a false clean — the Core
  Contract's forbidden bug — reachable only through a declaration an adopter writes deliberately, which is
  why every shape so far was found by reading rather than reported from the field. *Next trigger:* a
  Rust-valid spelling of any of those four properties that the pinned corpus does not already contain. What
  it would decide is whether this reader's corpus can be **enumerated** — the audit-cycle shape
  `PROJECT.md` records, where the enumeration is generated and staleness-checked rather than
  hand-maintained — instead of answered one shape at a time.

  **FIRED, at the release cut.** The spelling is a qualified applied `path`:
  `#[cfg_attr(any(), foo::path = "bogus.rs", path = "real.rs")] mod plat;`, which rustc 1.96.0 compiles
  because a false predicate expands no applied attribute and never resolves `foo::path`. It exercises the
  third property — whether a segment is reached through `::` — applied to the **target** rather than to the
  wrapper, and the pinned corpus holds only the wrapper half
  (`a_path_qualified_look_alike_is_not_cfg_attr`). Both scanners computed the qualification and spent it on
  the `cfg_attr` decision alone; `path_meta_values`' own doc comment stated the rule its `path` arm did
  not apply. Measured, one dimension perturbed at a time: 圭表 answered `1` — a violation against source
  the governed tree does not compile — and 漏刻 answered `0` over a seam whose only probe sat in that
  file, which is the fabricated coverage this entry's *Risk* names. 渾儀 takes the same question through
  `get_ident` and was correct.

  The local repair landed as `a_qualified_applied_path_is_not_a_module_target`, and it is the ninth wrong
  answer this entry's null option counts rather than an argument against it. **What has NOT been decided is
  the option**, and this entry is still where that waits: the firing establishes that the corpus is not
  enumerable by inspection, which is what the three options below are about. A local patch is not that
  decision and does not stand in for it. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch;
  every repair to date narrows what is read.

  **Three options, their costs, and the precedents each rests on.** Recorded here rather than decided,
  because where a shared lexical answer may live is an architectural call and this file is where such a
  call waits for one.

  **Null option — keep answering one spelling at a time.** Its cost is measured rather than feared: wrong
  answers in **all three dimensions** — the count is not written here, because the shapes are named in the
  `0.6.0` changelog entries that closed them and a figure maintained beside them would drift from that. Each
  is a **clean verdict** over source no build compiles, or a violation reported against source the governed
  tree does not have. Each was found by reading, none by a
  report from the field, and each repair was correct and followed by another shape. What it buys is that
  nothing structural moves. What it does not buy is any statement about what remains: the corpus is *every
  lexical form Rust admits*, which no inspection enumerates, so the next shape's arrival is the only
  evidence available about the last one's completeness.

  **Option A — a token boundary inside each dimension.** One reader per crate turns a span into tokens —
  an identifier with its raw prefix consumed, a path separator, a comma, a group open and close — with
  trivia handled once; the interpretation becomes a state machine over tokens whose states can be
  enumerated, which is the audit-cycle shape `PROJECT.md` records. *For:* it keeps 三儀 ⊥ 三儀 exactly as
  it stands, and the repository already treats independent hand-written implementations as a feature
  rather than a cost — `cfg_if_transparency_conformance` exists to hold two of them in step rather than
  merge them, and `PROJECT.md` records the `cfg_if` carve-out as *each hand-written*. *Against:* the same
  lexical logic is written twice, and `0.6.0` measured what that produces — 圭表 and 漏刻 each missed
  a different subset, and neither was the correct one. Duplication is not neutral here; it is the
  mechanism that generated two distinct hole sets from one question.

  **Option B — one lexical substrate below the dimensions.** *For:* `xingbiao` exists for precisely this
  failure mode — `PROJECT.md` records it as the shared workspace-data substrate *consolidated below the
  三儀 to prevent twin-drift* — and `0.6.0` put `is_absence` there for the same reason, after the same
  collapse was found in all three. One owner means a new spelling is one fix. *Against:* two costs, and
  the second is the one that decides it. First, `xingbiao`'s stated job is workspace data; a Rust
  tokenizer is not that, so either its charter widens or a crate is born — and the drift law admits a
  crate when it is built, not before. Second and sharper: **the conformance suites' value is that the
  implementations are independent.** Three readers disagreeing is what surfaced every one of these
  defects. A shared tokenizer makes a tokenizer defect invisible to all three at once, which trades a
  class of divergence for a class of silent agreement. That trade is bounded — the tokenizer would carry
  its own directions, and the suites would still cross-check interpretation — but it is a real one and
  it is the argument Option A rests on.

  *Evidence bearing on the choice — and the clause that stood here was falsified by the window that cited
  it.* It read: *渾儀 answers this same question through `syn` and has never carried one of these shapes.
  What failed is hand-rolled lexing specifically, in both crates that do it.* Both halves are false.

  渾儀 carried four, all closed in the `0.6.0` window, and in three of them it was the **only** wrong reader:
  a raw identifier spelling `path` or `cfg_attr` inside a `cfg_attr`, the same spelling on `derive` and on
  the `cfg_attr` wrapping one, and a raw spelling of the transparent macro's own name. None of those is a
  lexing defect — `syn` does the lexing, and what failed is `Path::is_ident` comparing an identifier **as
  written**. The byte scanners accepted the macro-name spelling that defeated it, and by accident rather
  than design: each walks backwards over identifier bytes from the `!`, and `#` is not one.

  The error also runs the other way — 圭表 and 漏刻 alone read a qualified applied `path`, where 渾儀's
  `get_ident` was correct — and once, on a raw bare `cfg`, all three were wrong together.

  So the class is **not a property of hand-rolling**, which is what the old clause turned into an argument
  for a token boundary. It is a property of comparing a name as written, and a reader can do that wrongly
  through `syn` as readily as through bytes — in opposite directions, on the same day. That does not reopen
  the decision below; it removes the one argument that pointed at Option A, since neither a token boundary
  nor a shared substrate would have reached the `syn`-side failures at all. The differential does, and did:
  reverting the `syn` comparison reports eighteen rows.

  *What would decide it:* a reading of whether the interpretation's states, once separated from lexing,
  are enumerable and generable — because that is what distinguishes this from a fourth hand-rolling. If
  they are, the enumeration is the instrument and the boundary is how it becomes possible; if they are
  not, Option A's independence argument wins on the evidence above. *Authority:* steward — neither option
  is a commit-level call.

  **DECIDED: none of the three, and the premise under *what would decide it* was false.** It assumed the
  boundary is *how enumeration becomes possible*. It is not: the enumeration was built over the readers **as
  they stand** and needed nothing structural, because what makes a differential possible is exactly the
  property Option A defends — the three implementations are independent, so they can be asked the same
  question separately. A boundary is the one thing that would have made it harder.

  Two parties are not enough, and that is what the instrument adds over a reading. A differential over the
  three dimensions alone answers *do they agree*, and agreement is not correctness — the raw bare-`cfg`
  spelling was missed by all three at once. So **rustc is the third party**:
  `crates/tianheng/tests/attribute_spelling_differential.rs` generates the corpus, compiles every shape,
  refuses one rustc will not take as the **generator's** defect rather than a dimension's, resolves an item
  defined only in the remap target wherever the predicate is live, and holds all three to the declared
  answer.

  What this buys is the sentence the null option could never write: over a generated corpus, every spelling
  is legal Rust and every dimension answers it identically. What it does not buy is the corpus being *every*
  lexical form Rust admits — the generator's axes are what someone thought to generate, which is strictly
  better than what someone thought to read, and unlike a reading it can be grown cheaply and its coverage is
  inspectable in one file. **Growing an axis is now the repair a new spelling earns**, rather than a patch to
  two scanners and a hope about the third.

  The instrument was checked for bite before its null result was believed: reverting 圭表's qualification
  narrowing reports two rows, 漏刻's reports two, 渾儀's raw-identifier comparison reports eighteen, and a
  deliberately malformed shape is reported against the generator rather than against any dimension.
  *Decided 2026-09-06 by the steward.*
- **WATCH: no fixture separates 圭表's two states for an unreadable module target.** *Observed pressure:*
  the `is_file()` absence/unreadable collapse was repaired in all three dimensions by routing every read
  through `xingbiao::is_regular_file` / `is_directory`, which carry the criterion. 渾儀's repair was seen to
  fail — measured, `left: 0 right: 2` with only its reader reverted, clean over a subtree it could not open
  — and 漏刻's has two directions of its own. **圭表's has none.** *Observation source:* measured on a
  `#[cfg]`-gated `pub mod imp;` whose `imp/` is mode `000`, with the boundary governing a sibling that
  resolves either way: 圭表 exits `2` **before and after**, loud for a reason this change does not touch, so
  an assertion over it would pass either way and say nothing. A first attempt pointed the boundary at the
  unreadable module itself and passed both ways for a second wrong reason — an unknown boundary target is a
  constitution error. *Current reaction or bound:* the repair travels on symmetry with the two that were
  seen to fail; `a_module_target_that_cannot_be_read_is_not_tolerated_as_absent` states the gap where a
  reader meets it. *Risk:* bounded — the change can only convert a silent tolerance into a loud refusal,
  never the reverse, so an unfalsified repair here cannot hide anything. What is unknown is whether 圭表's
  arm was reachable at all. *Next trigger:* a fixture that separates the two states, or a reading that shows
  the arm unreachable — either closes this. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* patch; nothing an adopter
  takes changes on the strength of this entry alone.

- **WATCH: the re-read races the wrapper can only narrow.** *Observed pressure:* the merge wrapper pins what
  the merge **records** by construction — the body travels as the value the gate judged, and the commit set
  through `--match-head-commit`, which GitHub decides atomically. What it is **judged against** can only be
  re-read after the gate, because `gh` offers no equivalent precondition. That shrinks the window from a whole
  `cargo test` to one API call and leaves it open inside that call. *Observation source:* the round that added
  the title re-read, and the review that found the residue cited a tracker whose trigger — *an act reaching
  either without the wrapper* — can never fire for a race reached only by going through it. *Current reaction
  or bound:* `repository-checks/an-input-edited-inside-its-own-post-gate-re-read-a-stated-bound`, and the
  re-reads themselves, pinned by `a_title_edited_while_the_gate_ran_stops_before_the_merge`,
  `a_base_changed_while_the_gate_ran_stops_before_the_merge` and
  `a_head_branch_renamed_while_the_gate_ran_stops_before_the_merge`, with
  `an_unmoved_pull_request_still_reaches_the_merge` as their shared control. *Risk:* the squash records a subject that is no
  longer the title, or lands on a base or comes from a head branch the gate never judged, in the one act that
  cannot be repaired —
  bounded by the window being a single API round trip and by the editor being a collaborator rather than an
  adversary. *Next trigger:* `gh` gaining a server-decided precondition for any of the three. **Not fired,
  measured 2026-09-06 against `gh` 2.46.0:** `--match-head-commit` is still the only one on offer, and it
  pins the head **object** — the endpoint the wrapper already uses, not one of the three names the races are
  about. *Authority:* engine.
  *Compatibility:* patch; the wrapper
  ships in no crate.

  **Half fired, 2026-09-05: the second judged input arrived, so this is a shape rather than an instance.**
  The prior trigger read *another judged input arriving that can only be re-read — the second would make this
  a shape rather than an instance*, and the base branch is that input: the one message exception is named by
  where the squash lands, `gh pr merge` takes no base of its own, and the base was captured once as evidence
  and never looked at again. The re-read is built and pinned; the bound is **widened rather than duplicated**,
  because the stop is a property of a client-side re-read not being atomic with the act it precedes, reached
  through whichever inputs are re-read. Its id moved with it — the retired spelling named the title alone, and
  is left to the commit and the dated changelog entry rather than written here, where a bare bound reference
  has to resolve. The head branch was first left out on the premise that GitHub offers no way to change an
  existing pull request's head; an independent review refuted it — renaming a branch retargets the pull
  requests on it, so `headRefName` moves while `headRefOid` does not — and it is re-read on the same terms. What has **not** fired is the toolchain half — `gh` 2.97.0 offers
  `--match-head-commit` and no equivalent for the title, the base or the head branch's name, re-measured
  2026-09-01.

- **WATCH: a merge or publish made outside the wrapper is not observed.** *Observed pressure:* both
  assertions guard the sanctioned path — the wrapper's `1 passed` and the reaction pinning the identifier it
  cites. A `cargo publish` run directly, or a merge made in the browser, reaches neither. *Risk:* the record
  or the published source escapes the gate that stands in front of it. *Next trigger:* an act reaching either
  without the wrapper. **FIRED, on `release: 0.5.0` (PR #845, 2026-08-28), and not by an operator slipping
  past.** The merge wrapper *could not perform it*: `AGENTS.md` names the release-branch-to-`main` squash as
  the **sole message exception** — subject `release: X.Y.Z`, body deliberately empty — and the gate refused
  both, as a non-Conventional subject and as an empty body. So the one merge the ritual cares about most was
  the one act structurally outside the wrapper, and `0.4.0`'s release commit carries an empty body too, so
  this had been true of every release. The gate learns the exception it was already told about, which is
  **more** observation and not less: the subject shape, the attribution marks and the title match are now
  judged on that merge where before none of them were. What remains of this entry is the half no repository
  can reach — a `cargo publish` run directly, or a merge made in the browser. *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* none — reaching further means observing the
  operator's shell or GitHub's servers rather than this repository.
- **WATCH: which governance member a check belongs to is unobserved.** *Observed pressure:* the split
  between 繩墨 (the law and the delivered product) and 勘合 (this repository's record) is a judgement about
  what a check judges, and two mechanical rules were each measured unreliable — a text scan reads a comment
  naming `AGENTS.md` as governance while a check scanning every tracked file names nothing, and
  `TIANHENG_WORKSPACE_TESTS` means both "this needs the repository as its subject" and "this needs a fixture".
  *Risk:* a check lands in the wrong member and the two identities blur again, which is the failure the
  split was built to end. *Next trigger:* a third member, or a check whose placement two readers disagree
  about. **Not fired** (evaluated 2026-08-31; `publish = false` still names exactly 勘合 and 繩墨, and no
  check's placement was disputed in the `0.6.0` window). *Authority:* engine. *Compatibility:* none — neither member ships.
  - **A `#[path]`-shared test module's `allow(dead_code)` cannot distinguish "used by no binary" from "used by
    some".** *Observed pressure:* `crates/tianheng/tests/support/` is compiled fresh into each `*_conformance.rs`
    binary, so an item only some callers use is genuinely dead in the others — which is why the blanket
    `#![allow(dead_code)]` there is correct and documented. It also silently covers an item used by **zero**
    binaries: `Header::comments` was added with the region newtypes, never called anywhere, and passed every
    clippy pass in the Definition of Done including the two that exist to catch dead code. *Observation source:*
    the 0.5.0 closing review's expanded dead-code sweep, after an external review found the sibling instance in
    the shell era's shared capture library; the method is deleted, the class is not. *Current reaction or bound:* none. Three
    clippy passes cover non-`pub` Rust and a `--workspace` pass exists precisely to catch dead code that ships,
    and none of them can see past a justified allow. *Risk:* a shared test helper accumulates an API nobody calls,
    which is worse in a support module than elsewhere — it reads as the blessed way to do something, so the next
    author adopts an untested path. *Promotion trigger:* a second item in `tests/support/` found dead by hand.
    One instance does not justify a cross-binary usage reaction, and building one is a design decision: the
    property is "referenced by at least one test binary", which needs an enumeration of binaries and their
    references rather than a compiler lint. *Version class:* tests only; no published surface. *Authority:* that
    module's own header, which states the allow and its reason, and `gate-shape-contract`, whose two-way
    correspondence between a gate and its twin is the shape any answer here would generalize.
  - **A changelog entry that refers to another by position breaks when the entries are regrouped.**
    *Observed pressure:* six positional cross-references in one `[Unreleased]` section; **three were broken** when
    found. Two had been wrong before anything moved — "the previous entry's own repair" pointed at
    `assert_projection_matches`, which has nothing to do with the repair it describes, and "a regression the
    previous entry introduced" attributed the shared exit-contract backstop to the entry beside it rather than to
    the backstop. The third was broken by merging the section's duplicate group headings: an entry saying "the
    entry below" pointed into `Documentation`, which the merge moved from last to first. *Observation source:* the
    closing review of the 0.5.0 window, sweeping `[Unreleased]` for positional references after the group merge;
    each antecedent was resolved by reading it rather than assumed. *Current reaction or bound:* none. The group
    merge's own verification compared the **multiset of lines** before and after, which is correct for "no entry
    text was lost" and structurally blind to "an entry still points at what it meant". *Risk:* an adopter follows
    a reference to the wrong entry, or to none — and a changelog is the one document written for people outside
    this repository. *Promotion trigger:* a positional reference appearing again after this sweep. Not a count:
    the sweep is the control, exactly as the un-reacted-SHALL entry above sets it up. *Why not simply forbidden:*
    three of the six resolve soundly and one of them is load-bearing — an entry citing the bullet immediately
    after it, within one group, which any regroup preserves. And references *into* `Documentation` are now
    structurally safe, since it is the first group and everything else is below it. A rule refusing "above" and
    "below" outright would refuse those three, so the rule has to distinguish a reference within a group from one
    across groups, which is a design decision rather than a grep. *Version class:* documentation only; no
    published surface. *Authority:* `release-coherence`, which owns what `CHANGELOG.md` must be true of, and this
    window's group-merge change, whose verification is the measured gap.
  - **Whether a gate's chosen exit code is the semantically right one.** *Observed pressure:* the class occurred
    once, in the 0.5.0 window, and produced **both** directions of `gate-shape-contract`'s `1-versus-2` bound in one
    gate — every refusal was `1`, so a shallow clone reported *"the release surfaces disagree"* (a
    misconfiguration as a violation), while the exit-contract backstop converted every genuine incoherence into
    `2` (a violation as cannot-judge). *Observation source:* that commit's own reproduction, and the re-reading
    that corrected the bound's stated cause. *Current reaction or bound:* the enabling mechanism is **closed** —
    what let the inversion pass CI was the matrix asserting a non-zero status rather than a code, and
    the retired gate-shape capability's `exit codes` property required the exact code from every twin, citing this
    instance in its remedy. What is left unobserved is the semantic judgment alone, and the bound now says so.
    *Risk:* a gate whose twin asserts an exact code that is the wrong code reads as fully conformant, and the
    consumer of a wrong code is sent looking for the wrong kind of problem. *Promotion trigger:* an instance where
    a twin asserts an **exact** code and that code is semantically wrong — a distinction the bound's earlier text
    could not have drawn, which is why this entry exists rather than the old wording standing as evidence for
    itself. *Version class:* patch. *Authority:* `gate-shape-contract`'s *Observation bounds* requirement, whose
    own rule that a bound is narrowed rather than restated is what this correction followed.
  - **A capability whose reactions are shell gates cannot pin a bound of its own.** `PINNED-BY` resolves a
    Rust test under `crates/`, while every defence of `observation-bound-register`,
    `self-law-projection`, and the gate surface of `violation-baseline` is a shell fixture — so such a
    capability can *state* a residual but not *declare* it, and the projection under-counts exactly where
    the register describes itself. Filed as READY-PATCH one change earlier, on a live instance that has
    since **dissolved**: the instance was "a definition inside a block comment satisfies a citation", and
    it was declared a residual only because the harness enumeration had been rejected twice on an
    unmeasured premise. Measured, a throwaway fixture crate enumerates cold in 107ms, so the residual was
    closed rather than declared and this entry lost the pressure that justified its class. Demoted to
    WATCH rather than closed, because the observation itself stands and is independent of that instance.
    Promotion trigger: a second such residual that is genuinely out of reach — one where the exact
    observation source has been *measured* and found unaffordable, not estimated from inside the code.
    That qualifier is the entry's real lesson. `gate-shape-contract` did **not** fire it, and the way it
    avoided doing so is worth stating: the same limitation decided its shape — a shell-defended capability
    could not have pinned its own declared bounds — and the answer was to write the reaction in Rust, not to declare
    a residual. An entry recording that shell gates cannot pin bounds is not evidence for itself every time
    a capability chooses Rust because of it.
  - **`BoundaryKind` has no value a third-party participant owns.** *Observed pressure:* an outside
    `Observer` must label every violation it emits with one of 三儀's four kinds — `Crate`, `Module`,
    `Semantic`, `Runtime` — even when it governs nothing any dimension would call by those names.
    *Observation source:* `examples/observer-participant`, written for the change that gave
    `Observer::bounds` a consumer; its house rule is a file-header convention, and it reports `Module`
    as the nearest honest fit with a comment saying so. *Current reaction or bound:* none — the kind is
    accepted as written, and nothing checks that a participant's kind matches what it governs.
    *Risk, corrected by measurement:* the kind is the label a **report** and a **SARIF render** carry, so a
    consumer filtering by kind sees an outsider's findings as 圭表's. It does **not** reach a baseline. An
    earlier version of this entry said it did, and the code says otherwise: `BaselineEntry` carries
    `{ id, rule, finding, owner, tracker }`, `ViolationId` is `{ target, rule_key, fact }`, `RuleKey` is
    `{ rule_type, fields }`, `Baseline::to_json` emits no kind at all, and de-duplication is by `ViolationId`.
    So a borrowed kind cannot mis-group an adopter's recorded entries and cannot make one stale — which
    lowers this entry's urgency by exactly the half that would have forced a decision before publication.
    *Promotion trigger, made fireable:* the previous wording asked for a participant that is not this
    repository's own example, which **could not fire before `0.5.0` ships** — no third party can write an
    `Observer` against an unpublished trait, so the trigger demanded evidence the release itself has to exist
    to produce. It now reads: an `Observer` implementation outside this repository — an adopter's, or a
    second one here written for a different purpose — whose borrowed kind is shown to mislead a real report
    consumer or SARIF ingest. One example that chose its own label is still not evidence about adopters.
    *Version class:* minor at most. Adding a variant to a `#[non_exhaustive]` enum breaks no downstream
    match, and it changes no verdict; what it changes is the projection vocabulary, which is why it is a
    decision rather than an addition. Deferring is the reversible half: a variant, once shipped, cannot be
    unshipped. *Authority:* `observer-protocol`'s requirement that a participant outside the family be
    demonstrated joining a run, and that example's README, which records the finding where someone writing
    their own participant will meet it.

    *What the rest of the new vocabulary was measured against, and passed.* Before `0.5.0` publishes the
    observation protocol, every vocabulary type it adds was read against one question — does a third party own
    a value, or must they borrow one of this family's? `BoundaryKind` fails it because `Crate`/`Module`/
    `Semantic`/`Runtime` name 三儀's own dimensions. Every other type passes, because each names a **role** an
    outsider occupies rather than a member of this family: `Owner` is `Engine` (theirs) / `Inherited` / `Adopter`;
    `Extent` and `Reached` name positions any reaction can be in relative to its own observation; `Demonstrates`
    names directions any pinning test can take; `FactGranularity` names properties of a fact; `Defence` is
    `PinnedBy` (their test) or `Unpinned` (their tracker), and its two variants cover the whole space of *bounds*
    because a construction-held property is stated in requirement prose rather than declared as one. `BoundId::new`
    accepts any `Into<Cow<'static, str>>` precisely so a computed id is expressible. The recurrence this review
    was opened to look for is therefore not there, and that is the finding.
  - Token/Lexer extraction (requires cross-scanner false negative or 3rd scanner).
  - `qianyi` generator & LSP/editor integration.
  - ~~A `#[cfg_attr(pred, path=…)]` remap on an **inline** `mod name { … }`~~ **CLOSED** in the 0.4.0
    window. Reproduced against the real entry point, as this entry's own trigger required, with the
    unconditional `#[path]` form as the control — and the reproduction **refuted the recorded risk
    class**. The entry predicted a false negative ("the arm's real children may never be scanned");
    the actual behaviour was a *constitution error* (exit 2, "source file could not be located"),
    so it was fail-loud, never a silent pass. What it really was is narrower and worse for adoption
    than for correctness: 圭表 refused to judge a crate that compiles cleanly, so an adopter using the
    idiom could not run `check` at all. The root cause was one line — `walk.rs` read only
    `direct_path_eq` and never `conditional_path_eqs` — and the fix follows every present candidate
    base, cfg-blind, exactly as 漏刻's spec already required for the identical shape. The lesson kept:
    a single-lens hypothesis can be right that something is broken and wrong about **how**, and the
    risk class is what decides urgency — so reproduce before promoting, which is what this entry's
    trigger said and why it was worth keeping.
  - ~~`xingbiao::crate_root_file` may collapse a multi-root package~~ **RETIRED — superseded by its
    own promotion.** Its trigger was "confirm `cargo metadata` actually emits multiple root files for
    one package before treating this as more than speculative". That was confirmed in the 0.4.0
    window (`[[bin]]` targets are reported alongside the `lib`, each with its own `src_path`), which
    promoted the hypothesis into the DESIGN-BREAKING entry above — now itself CLOSED by the
    per-target corpus. The WATCH line survived its own promotion and is struck here rather than
    deleted, since a reader of an older release may still be looking for it. Lesson kept: when a
    WATCH item is promoted, retire the WATCH line in the same change, or the index carries the
    question and its answer at once.
  - Baseline debt ratchet (`--require-baseline-reduction`, only-fix-never-add). This remains in
    tension with “baseline is a generated snapshot, not policy” and “not a governance platform”:
    a bounded opt-in gate may fit, while debt scheduling does not. Promote only after that tension
    is resolved with adopter pressure and an explicit observation/reaction design.
  - **`xuanji` sink for shared run/projection vocabulary.** Class: WATCH. Observed pressure:
    `pacta` consumes the composed facade while `modou` consumes and re-exports Guibiao's widened
    standalone check/baseline/projection surface. Observation source: those reference-consumer
    builds and the current crate dependency graph. Current bound: keep dimension-owned
    projection/check surfaces above vocabulary-neutral `xuanji`; sinking them now would break the
    proven standalone Guibiao consumer without demonstrated cross-dimension deduplication. Risk:
    duplicated shell vocabulary may grow if multiple instruments acquire standalone products.
    Promotion trigger: a second standalone instrument consumer (Hunyi or Louke) demonstrates the
    same projection/run need and makes a shared sink earn its migration cost. Version class:
    DESIGN-BREAKING. Authority: `PROJECT.md`'s crate-family and dimension-independence decisions,
    `openspec/specs/rule-model-surface/spec.md` reference-consumer contract, and the Pacta/Modou
    compatibility evidence recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **ACCEPTED DEBT:**
  - Macro/configuration coverage bounds. **One** named residual now that all three dimensions read
    `cfg_if!` arms: transparency covers **item position** only — an invocation inside an
    `impl`/`trait` body holds impl items, needing a parallel flattening across ~10 body walkers
    (measured, pinned by `a_cfg_if_inside_an_impl_body_is_a_stated_bound`). 漏刻's own lack of
    transparency, listed here as the second residual, is CLOSED: its byte scanner reads arm contents
    as real code in both passes, and `cfg_if_transparency_conformance.rs` now pins all three
    dimensions on the one fixture rather than two of three — its module doc already says so, and this
    entry was the site left behind.
  - ~~File-granular un-auditable-probe identity.~~ **RETIRED** — superseded, not accepted: the 0.4.0
    line qualifies an un-auditable-probe fact by its owner-qualified enclosing item and the offending
    expression's own text alongside its file, so the identity is no longer file-granular and this bound
    no longer exists. Kept struck rather than deleted because a reader of an older release may still be
    looking for it.
  - **漏刻's legacy directory corpus does not descend a symlinked subdirectory.** Measured on one
    fixture rather than hypothesised: a module reached through `#[path]` into a symlinked directory,
    holding a declared seam's only probe, is seen when the audit is given the **target root file**
    (clean — the module graph reaches it and reading a file follows symlinks) and unseen when it is
    given the **directory** (the seam reads as unprobed). Deliberate: the directory walk classifies
    entries with `file_type()`, which does not follow symlinks, so a symlinked directory is not
    recognized as one — which is what keeps a cyclic symlink from becoming an unbounded walk. Accepted
    because the input that matters has no gap: the 天衡 shell passes root files, and the directory input
    exists for source compatibility. Stated in `runtime-origin-assertion` and pinned in both directions
    by `a_symlinked_subdirectory_is_descended_from_a_root_file_and_not_from_a_directory`. This replaces
    a WATCH entry that guessed a different mechanism — "`try_visit`'s cycle guard possibly bypassed by a
    second, weaker guard" — which is refuted: no guard is bypassed, and the entry did not distinguish
    the two corpora, which is where the whole answer lives.
  - **The baseline directory flush has no reacting test, by construction.** `sync_parent_dir` is
    infallible and best-effort on purpose — a platform or filesystem that cannot flush a directory
    must not turn an already-landed write into a reported failure — which leaves it with no
    externally observable behavior for a test to bind. Measured rather than assumed: `cargo mutants`
    over `runner.rs` reports both of its mutants (`replace sync_parent_dir with ()`, `delete !`) as
    MISSED, while the mutants for the flag and zero-length rules beside it are caught. Its evidence
    is the syscall sequence recorded in the PR that added it (`fsync(temp)` → `rename` →
    `fsync(dir)`), not a gate. Accepted because the alternative — making it fallible, or counting
    failures the way 漏刻's `dropped_sink_events` does — either reintroduces the regression it exists
    to avoid or adds an adopter-visible counter for a CLI-side hygiene step nobody can read. Revisit
    only if a directory-flush regression is ever actually observed. The *strict* half of the
    guarantee (the file flush) is not in this bound: it is covered by the `baseline_cli`
    suite.
- **DECLINED:**
  - Wall-clock auto-decay / auto-expiration (breaks determinism).
  - Trait method set freezing (API contract, not architectural shape).
  - Pre-creating empty crates/modules.
  - `GovernanceTest` standard-preamble generator API (`standard_preamble(test_name: &str)`
    or equivalent). Drift law: no API surface without adoption pressure. The preamble discipline
    (universals only, no architectural claims) is a documentation concern, not an API contract;
    `assert_projection_fresh_with_preamble` already accepts a caller-supplied `&str`. If three
    adopters independently write incorrect preambles containing architectural claims that then
    rot, revisit.
  - "`.github/CODEOWNERS`'s amendment reaction is unenforced" (0.4.0 sweep). Self-refuted by its
    own citation: the file's own disclaimer at the cited line already states plainly that
    designation alone only auto-requests review, and that branch protection must be separately
    enabled to make it binding — not a hidden gap.
  - "`ci.yml`'s Release-coherence job is the one Definition-of-Done gate CI runs but branch
    protection doesn't enforce" (0.4.0 sweep). Observations reproduced accurately, but none
    constitutes a defect under this project's own contract taxonomy — CI running a check and
    branch protection gating a merge are different, both-documented mechanisms, not a claimed
    single guarantee.
  - "漏刻 never diagnoses a module cycle (a circular `#[path]`/symlinked module directory
    silently collapses instead of exit 2)" (0.4.0 sweep). Refuted: a test already pins the exact
    shape, asserting the opposite of the claim — a documented, deliberately-pinned bound, not an
    undetected divergence.
  - "The self-law giving `xingbiao` its canonicalization monopoly only reacts to the
    free-function form; `path.canonicalize()` (the method call) escapes" (0.4.0 sweep). The
    mechanism reproduces, but it is an explicitly declared, spec'd, and test-pinned observation
    bound of the observation source itself — not a silent false negative, and not a reason
    outside the projected perimeter.
  - "A duplicated field name in a baseline entry's fact is silently last-wins, so the entry
    suppresses a different violation than the one it records" (0.4.0 sweep,
    `crates/xuanji/src/identity.rs`). Mechanics reproduced (`Baseline::from_json` on a
    duplicate-keyed `fact.fields` object does resolve last-wins), but the claim does not survive
    the contract lens — the shape cannot arise from any real fact construction path in this
    codebase, only from hand-authored malformed JSON.
  - "The composed baseline dogfood (`cargo test -p shengmo --test examples_suite`) exercises only the suppression
    direction, and its in-script justification misstates what the standalone test proves"
    (0.4.0 sweep). Refuted: a test-coverage complaint dressed as an unhonored claim — every
    documented claim it cites is in fact honored by the referenced test and README.
  - "Feature rules never read the target's own `[features]` table, so `serde/derive` declared
    there passes a rule that forbids every feature of `serde`" (0.4.0 sweep,
    `crates/guibiao/src/cargo_metadata.rs`). Mechanics accurate, but doubly refuted: the behavior
    is a stated bound (圭表 governs the *declared* per-target layer; resolved whole-graph
    feature unification is `cargo-deny`'s lane, per this file's own architecture decision), and
    separately the specific reproduction's classification didn't hold either.
  - "A `cfg_attr`-wrapped `#[path]` target is never enqueued, so the relocated file's typo'd /
    un-auditable probes are silently skipped" (0.4.0 sweep, `crates/louke/src/audit/scan/probes.rs`).
    Refuted: a stated bound spelled out in three places (spec, public API doc, `CHANGELOG.md`)
    and pinned by a deliberate test, not introduced by the diff under audit.
  - "`first_macro_arg_end` truncates an `as`-cast generic, merging two textually distinct
    un-auditable probes into one finding" (0.4.0 sweep, `crates/louke/src/audit/scan/lexer.rs`).
    Mechanics reproduce at the byte-scanner level, but the trigger is not reachable from
    compilable adopter input — refuted on the reproduction lens.
- **BUILT / HISTORY:**
  - Opt-in gate flag `--disallow-stale` enforcing zero stale baseline entries in CI gate mode.
  - Non-generic compound type alias target traversal in `hunyi` (tuples, arrays, slices, references, raw pointers).
  - Mid-path `super` and `self` module path normalization in `guibiao`.
  - `cfg_if!` macro expansion unstripping and ancestor-glob fail-closed observation in `guibiao`.
  - `cfg_if!` arm transparency in `hunyi` (item position: arm items collected, arm-declared modules
    walked, arm membership treated as cfg-conditional), pinned against `guibiao` on one shared
    fixture.
  - Configurable custom probe macro marker attributes in `louke`.
  - Three-layer agent-law artifact naming (Preamble + Projection + Law Source) and `COOKBOOK.md` recipe with `GovernanceTest` preamble discipline.
  - `cfg_attr(path)` observe-both semantics (union-scan over default and physically existing `cfg_attr(path)` target paths).
  - `guibiao`'s own module-boundary walk now tolerates a module backed only by one or more resolved `cfg_attr(path)` remaps (no plain conventional file, no direct `#[path]`), matching `hunyi`/`louke`'s identical rule for the same shape.
  - Reusable testing harness (`tianheng::testing::GovernanceTest` fluent builder in facade for reaction, coverage, projection freshness with `BLESS=1`, and fixture testing).
  - Self-governance observation depth upgrade (explicit ScanDepth declarations across crates/shengmo/src/law.rs boundaries).
  - `PublicSeam::InherentMethod`/`InherentAssoc` now carry the impl block's own declaring module,
    closing the two-different-modules false negative verified real during the 0.4.0 sweep
    (`hunyi-public-seam-module-injection`).
  - `unsafe_confinement`'s and `trait_impl`'s `allowed_locations` (`only_implemented_in`/`and_in`,
    `only_under`) now reject a malformed `::`-path entry (an empty segment) as a constitution error,
    sharing the `must_not_expose`/`must_not_acquire` forbidden-operand family's guard
    (`resolve::validate_path_operands`, extracted from four verbatim call sites at the same time).
    Closes the entry previously recorded here as ACCEPTED DEBT: reproduced directly against
    `trait_impl_findings`/`unsafe_findings` before fixing, confirming the failure direction the
    debt entry named (a malformed allowed entry made every real site look disallowed, a spurious
    violation rather than a silent pass) — both named call sites are now fixed, not merely one
    (`hunyi-shared-path-operand-validation`).

### Closed — reproduction records (0.4.0 onward)

- ~~**WATCH: a promotion trigger is a predicate, and nothing holds one to the corpus of the thing it
  watches.**~~ **CLOSED — adopted.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the 2026-09-01 sweep of this file's unevaluated triggers,
  which set out to date them and instead found three written over a set wider or narrower than the residue
  they guard, in both directions. *The branch-name entry* named two shapes and the drift arrived through a
  third, so its trigger could not fire on the instance that occurred. *The constructor-shadowing entry* said
  *this repository's own source* where the reader reads `crates/kanhe/src`, so it stood satisfied nine times
  over with the residue unrealised. *The Definition-of-Done entry* said *coverage* where it meant *naming*,
  and stood satisfied twice over by steps that are in the list. All three are rewritten in place. *Observation
  source:* that sweep, and one instance this file had already recorded on its own — the title-race entry
  notes a tracker whose trigger, *an act reaching either without the wrapper*, can never fire for a race
  reached only by going **through** it. That fourth instance is what makes this a class rather than three
  slips: it was found in the same way, one entry at a time, by a reader who happened to hold both halves.
  *Current reaction or bound:* none, and none is available. Deciding whether a trigger's set is the residue's
  set means knowing what the entry means, which is intent rather than shape — the judgement-over-text class
  this repository has measured and rejected. *Risk:* a WATCH entry reads as armed and is not. That is worse
  than an unarmed entry that says so, because the file's whole discipline is that a filed class is answered
  rather than forgotten, and a trigger nobody can trip converts filing into forgetting. Bounded by the
  triggers being read by a person against the tree — which is how all four were found, and also why three
  windows passed before they were. *Promotion trigger:* a fifth instance, or a trigger found to have fired
  unnoticed for a whole window. **BOTH HALVES FIRED 2026-09-06, in one sweep.**

  *A trigger fired unnoticed for a whole window.* The positional-reference entry's trigger — *a positional
  reference appearing again after this sweep* — fired **four times** across the 0.6.0 window's 100 landed
  changes, and one of the four already pointed at the wrong entry. Nothing surfaced it until the triggers
  were read against the window on purpose. That is the exact shape this half was written to catch, and what
  it caught is that reading them is an act somebody has to schedule.

  *And a fifth instance.* The entry sorting triggers into swept and witnessed named only the direction where
  a witness-only one turns out cheap, leaving it unable to fire on a swept verdict that no sweep could have
  reached — a trigger narrower than the residue it guards, which is this entry's own class. It is widened,
  and the widening's first instance was standing when it landed.

  Two independent instances in one reading raises what the entry can conclude: the four originals were found
  *one at a time by a reader who happened to hold both halves*, and these two were found by asking the
  question of every trigger at once. **The reachable half is therefore the occasion rather than the
  instrument** — a per-window sweep is a thing a person can be asked for, where a rule that triggers name
  their corpus still needs the judgement-over-text this file has rejected. The re-decision is the steward's. *Why not a rule that triggers name their corpus:* it would be a rule about
  how prose is written with no reaction behind it, and the bar the `0.6.0` window set is that a rule needs a
  reachable instance — this has four, so the rule is earned, but its instrument is not, and the honest form
  is prose with the reason stated. *Version class:* patch; this file ships in no crate. *Authority:* this
  entry, and `AGENTS.md`'s *Bind a claim to its measurement*, whose three bindings this is the trigger-shaped
  case of.

  **Adopted as an occasion, not an instrument.** `AGENTS.md`'s *Branching and release* now holds that `BACKLOG.md`'s promotion triggers are read against the window before the cut. What decided it was the reading itself: fifteen entries produced eight defects sitting behind triggers already written, and the two instances that fired this entry were found by asking every trigger at once rather than one at a time by a reader who happened to hold both halves. No rule that triggers name their corpus is adopted — that still needs the judgement-over-text this file has rejected three times.

- ~~**WATCH: half this file's promotion triggers can be swept for and half can only be witnessed, and nothing
  says which.**~~ **CLOSED — adopted.** *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* the 2026-09-01 sweep, which set out to give every
  unevaluated trigger a dated state and found that they are not one instrument. Most turn on a property of
  the tree, of the installed toolchain, or of this repository's own merged history, and anyone can decide
  them by running something — those now carry a verdict and what was checked. The rest turn on an occurrence
  that leaves no trace to sweep for: a review round choosing the wrong binding, a window in which a class
  costs a review round, a count finding after the disposal rule, a third instance of a shape only a reader
  recognises, an input two people failed to construct, a harness someone would have to design, a syntax
  someone would have to declare, and an audit that is a window's work. *Observation source:* that sweep, and
  the shape of what it could and could not answer. *Current reaction or bound:* none. *Risk:* the two kinds
  read identically, so a witness-only trigger looks armed while nothing will ever trip it — the entry is
  filed, the class is answered on paper, and the observation it needs is one that has to be written down by
  whoever is present at the moment it happens, which is exactly what does not happen when the entry reads as
  already handled. Bounded, and this is the useful half: several of these entries already say in their own
  text that what they ask for is a record made at the time, so the discipline exists and only the label is
  missing. *Promotion trigger, widened 2026-09-06 to the second direction:* a trigger sorted into either
  kind found to belong to the other — a witness-only one trippable all along by something anyone could have
  run, **or** one carrying a swept verdict that no sweep could have reached. Either would mean the two kinds
  were sorted wrong, not that the sorting is worthless.

  **It fires on the widening's own instance, and the re-decision is the steward's.** *The OpenSpec capability
  lifecycle is retained and has never been exercised* carried `Not fired, swept 2026-09-01` over an
  observable the lifecycle's own step 5 destroys — so a verdict was written in the register of the kind that
  can be swept, for a trigger belonging to the kind that can only be witnessed. The trigger as first written
  could not have caught it: it named the direction in which a witness-only trigger turns out to be cheap, and
  this is the direction in which a swept one turns out to be impossible. That is the more dangerous half,
  because a dated verdict reads as **settled** rather than as waiting, which is a stronger claim than the
  *looks armed* this entry's own *Risk* paragraph budgeted for. *Why not a field on every entry:* a new field is a form to maintain, and the property is
  already legible from the trigger's own sentence once someone has asked the question of it. What was
  missing was the question, and it is asked here. *Version class:* patch; this file ships in no crate.
  *Authority:* this entry, and the trigger-corpus entry above, of which this is the other half — that one
  asks whether a trigger's set is the residue's set, and this one asks whether anyone can ever evaluate it.

  **Adopted in a narrower form than it proposed.** Per-entry labels sorting triggers into swept and witnessed are **declined** on this entry's own objection — a field on sixty entries is a form to maintain. What `AGENTS.md` takes instead constrains the **verdict** rather than the trigger: an evaluation records what it checked, and one no sweep could have reached says so rather than carrying a date. That reaches the failure this entry measured — a dated `Not fired, swept` over an observable the lifecycle destroys, reading as settled where the honest word is unobserved — at the point where it happens, and costs nothing to maintain.

- ~~**WATCH: `AGENTS.md`'s OpenSpec lifecycle section describes a process with no instances.**~~ **DECIDED —
  the lifecycle is retained.** The trigger was *a human call about intent*, and the steward made it on
  2026-08-31: a new capability must go through OpenSpec, so the section stays. The absence of instances is
  explained rather than unexplained — the recent windows were patches and prose, and neither is a capability
  change.

  *And the entry read a rule as a claim about the tree, which is the part worth keeping.* It called the
  present-indicative *A capability change **moves through** OpenSpec* "prose stating a fact about the tree
  that the tree contradicts", and counted zero instances as the contradiction. A **rule** is not falsified by
  having no instances; it is left **unexercised**. The evidence the entry gathered was real and its reading
  of that evidence was the error — the same distinction this window wrote into `AGENTS.md`'s bar one document
  over, where a rule needs a reachable instance to earn a *reaction* and not to be true.

  *What the entry got right and what survives.* Half the section is live and load-bearing: the sync-evidence
  rule is followed, and `openspec/changes/archive/.gitkeep` is tracked exactly as described. What remains is
  narrower than the entry and is filed as its own watch above: the lifecycle is retained and unexercised, so
  the next capability change is the first thing that will tell anyone whether it still works.

- ~~**`0.5.0`'s row in the published-artifact provenance record cannot be written until after it is
  published, and the branch that could carry it is archived first.**~~ **BUILT** — the trigger fired when
  `0.5.0` reached crates.io on 2026-08-28, and the row was written on `release/0.6.0`, the first branch able
  to carry it. Measured rather than predicted: all six tarballs pulled from `static.crates.io` and their
  `.cargo_vcs_info.json` read, one distinct sha1 across the six, and it is the commit `v0.5.0` names — so the
  verdict is *agrees with the tag*. The sha1 itself is written in the record, where a commit object is
  reachable by name; live text anchors to the release. The scope line was restated rather than having its figure bumped: the 2026-08-05 audit
  covered the 96 tarballs then on the books and the six new ones were audited on their publication day, so
  the sentence now says which audit covered what instead of letting one date stand for both.

  *What it said, and where it reasoned wrongly.* The entry existed because the row is an audit **of the
  tarballs** and so cannot precede them, while the branch that would carry it is archived at the release
  squash and `main` takes nothing except through a release branch. It called the resulting one-cycle lag
  **structural** — and that word did the damage. The constraint it described was real, but a constraint is
  only structural relative to a premise, and the premise here was *that a commit sha1 is kept in this
  repository at all*. The entry never asked whether it should be. Once that question was put, the answer
  removed the lag rather than accommodating it: the registry already holds the sha1 permanently, a committed
  copy is the only half that can go stale, and forty hexadecimal characters were costing a branch, a pull
  request, a full CI run and a squash merge to arrive one release late. The inventory is closed, and there is
  no lag because there is nothing further to append.

  The shape is worth keeping even though the entry closed correctly: **calling a consequence structural is
  how a premise escapes being examined.** The entry was accurate about every step below the premise and
  wrong about the one thing that mattered.

  It also named the part that is easy to miss — adding a row without restating the scope line makes the
  document claim an audit that never covered it — and that is what the edit did.

- ~~**WATCH: a dependency declared under a cfg target carrying a dot is not observed.**~~ **RETIRED** — the
  reader it described was replaced, and the shape it warned about cannot arise in the one that replaced it.

  *What it said.* The example-pin reader decided which tables hold dependencies from the heading, and stepped
  past a `[target.…]` context by finding the first dot in the joined name. A cfg expression carrying a dot put
  that step inside the expression, so a stale family pin under `[target.'cfg(target_os = "l.x")'.dependencies]`
  reached a release unobserved.

  *Why it is gone rather than reworded.* The heading now arrives as its keys — cut at the dots outside quotes,
  each unquoted and decoded — so the expression is one key whatever it contains and there is no dot for the
  context step to land inside. The change was made for a different defect (the escaped spelling of a dot
  collapsing a literal key into a path) and took this with it.

  *Measured, not argued.* Cargo reads the dependency under both spellings it accepts, reporting it with that
  target. The bound's own WHEN is in the tree as `a_pin_under_a_cfg_target_carrying_a_dot_is_read`, and with
  the quote-aware cut removed each row returns *ok release coherence* over a stale pin — the bound's own
  description, reproduced. Its scenario in `openspec/specs/release-coherence/spec.md` is an ordinary pinned one
  now, and the declaration is gone from `crates/kanhe/src/bounds.rs`. *Authority:* engine.
  *Compatibility:* patch; the check ships in no crate.

- ~~**`observation-bound-model`'s projection discloses its own bounds by a typed list; its sibling requires a**~~ **DISSOLVED** — both of its premises are gone, and so is the problem.

  *The sibling it was to copy no longer exists.* The Shape reads *lift the derived-disclosure requirement
  into `observation-bound-model`* — that requirement belonged to `gate-shape-contract`, whose spec was
  retired in the 0.5.0 window; its holder `the_projection_discloses_every_declared_bound` is gone with
  it. There is nothing left to lift, and the entry's Authority named it as the shape to copy.

  *And the problem it describes is not the tree's state.* `docs/observation-bound-extents.md` is rendered
  wholly derived: the leading figure is `false_negatives.len()` against `code.len()`, and every disclosed id
  comes out of a loop over the declared bounds. Its own prose states the reason this entry was filed for —
  *a list typed here is a literal in a template and the freshness check compares that text with itself* —
  and then does not type one.

  Dissolved rather than rewritten, because a retirement swept its Authority away and the state it warned
  about was answered independently. **Recorded rather than deleted**: the measurement that found both is the
  expensive part, and an entry silently removed is one the next audit re-derives. The entry is kept verbatim
  below.

  derived one.** *Class:* READY-PATCH. *Observed pressure:* `gate-shape-contract` hit this and wrote the
  requirement — *"That disclosure SHALL be **derived from the specification, not typed into the generator**,
  and held to it in both directions"* — with `the_projection_discloses_every_declared_bound` holding it and a
  vacuity guard. `observation-bound-model` has the same shape and only the weaker requirement (*"The projection
  SHALL state what it does not claim, in its own header"*), so its "what this document does not claim"
  paragraph enumerated members as a literal in the generator's template, where the freshness check compares
  that text with itself. *Observation source:* the final sweep of the 0.5.0 window, which found the paragraph
  naming two limits while the capability declared three; the enumeration is removed from the template as an
  immediate stop, so what remains is the missing requirement rather than a live falsehood. *Current reaction or
  bound:* none — the projection now points at `docs/observation-bound-extents.md` instead of listing.
  *Risk:* the same class the sibling already paid for, in the one place a freshness check structurally cannot
  see. *Promotion trigger:* fired — the sibling's requirement exists and this one's absence was measured.
  *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `gate-shape-contract`, whose
  requirement is the shape to copy, and `observation-bound-model`, which would carry it.
  *Shape:* lift the derived-disclosure requirement into `observation-bound-model`, and give it a holder
  of the same shape — declared headings read from the spec, held
  set-equal to what the projection discloses, both directions, with the empty-enumeration guard.

- ~~**Markdown readers in `capability_subjects` still take a bare `&str` where `region` exists.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window across four changes: `Prose` gained a numbered form and
  `restatement::document_offences` took a region; `sections::cut` was built and `section_shape` /
  `adopter_cited_machinery` moved onto it; `require_changelog_state` / `unreleased_has_item` followed and
  `Section` gained the sentinel line as written; and `subject_globs` / `proposal_capabilities` were the last.

  **The entry said four signatures and there were five.** It named
  `release_coherence_gate::{require_changelog_state, require_section_shape, unreleased_has_item}` and
  `restatement::document_offences`, and missed `adopter_cited_machinery` — a fifth walk over the same
  document, on the same predicate, byte-level twin of `section_shape`'s. It was found by reading the
  callers of `section_of` rather than by re-reading this entry, which is the correction worth keeping: a
  set enumerated once in prose is a set nothing re-counts.

  **The latency direction is retired rather than narrowed, and was held to its own WHEN before going.** A
  fence planted in a tracked spec was refused by it while the migrated readers read that same file
  correctly; then it went, because what it protected no longer exists and a protection kept past its
  instance turns its next firing into a false alarm — an ordinary document carrying a code block would
  have been next. `CHANGELOG.md` had already left its corpus one change earlier, for the same reason.
  The shapes it stood in for are decided by
  `a_fenced_subject_heading_opens_no_section` and the `sections` failure matrix now.

  The entry is kept verbatim below.

  *Class:* READY-PATCH — **the promotion trigger below has fired**, the prerequisite it named is built, and
  every reader over `CHANGELOG.md` has moved. No count in the title: the set shrinks as the migration
  proceeds, and nothing produces the figure.
  *Observed pressure:* `region`'s own header made this an absolute — *a corpus is never handed to a
  recognizer as `&str`* — and the readers in the same crate that contradict it are now
  `capability_subjects::{subject_globs, proposal_capabilities}`. A fenced `## Subject` or `## Capabilities`
  would be read as the section it resembles. *Observation source:* a review read the sentence against the crate, and the
  sentence is now narrowed to executed text with the residue stated where it was claimed away.
  *Current reaction or bound:* the misread itself is unheld; its **latency** is held —
  `the_corpora_of_the_bare_str_markdown_readers_carry_no_fence_or_comment_span` produces the figures this
  entry used to type, over `CHANGELOG.md` and every `openspec/specs/*/spec.md`, with a vacuity guard on each
  half. Not covered there: `document_offences`'s wider corpus, whose residue is conditional rather than a
  count — a fenced block naming a crate together with *every* member of its allowlist — since holding that
  means running the restatement rule inside a fence, which is the reader this entry exists to replace.
  *Risk:* a release gate reading a fenced heading as a section, or a restatement check skipping a document it
  should judge — both toward a false pass, which is the direction the Core Contract forbids.
  *Promotion trigger:* **fired.** It was *the first fenced block in `CHANGELOG.md` or in a spec* — and one
  arrived, in a changelog entry recording a negative run, which the direction refused. The trigger was filed
  as one only a person re-reading the tree could notice; what noticed it was the direction, on an ordinary
  run, which is the whole reason it produces its figures instead of typing them.
  *Version class:* patch; every site is in a crate that ships in no package.
  *Authority:* `release-coherence` and `self-law-projection`. *Shape:* give `Prose` a numbered form —
  `numbered_lines`, as `Executed` already has — then take `Prose` in the signatures.
  **The prerequisite is built and one signature has moved.** `Prose::numbered_lines` enumerates before it
  filters, so a fenced block consumes its positions rather than renumbering what follows;
  `restatement::document_offences` takes a region and reads a block's start off the first line it actually
  holds, rather than deriving it from the blank line above — arithmetic that pointed into the fence prose had
  just dropped. That also closed this entry's one *conditional* residue: the restatement rule never sees a
  fence now, so it no longer has to be run inside one. Measured before moving it, over every tracked file the
  check reads: the bare corpus and the prose corpus reported the identical offence set, so what changed is
  which documents it *could* misread rather than which it did.

  **Four of the five signatures have moved, and the corpus the latency is held over narrowed with them.**
  `sections::cut` owns the boundary question and each caller's predicate the naming one, which is the split
  `section_of`'s own doc asked for; `Section` carries the sentinel line as written, because a derived name is
  lossy where a ` - DATE` suffix is dropped. `CHANGELOG.md` left the latency corpus when the last reader
  judging it took a region — a protection kept past the instance it protected turns its next firing into a
  false alarm, and an ordinary changelog entry carrying a code block would have tripped it. What remains is
  `capability_subjects`'s two, whose predicate differs from the changelog's (one exact heading, closing on any
  `## `) and whose cost is rippling into their callers.

These are **not** open work. Each was a live item in this index and is now closed;
the original entry is kept verbatim beneath its closing note because the reproduction record —
what was observed, by which lens, and why the trigger was believed narrower than it was — is the part
that stops the same defect being re-found from scratch. The present-tense `Class:` / `Risk:` /
`Promotion trigger:` lines inside each retained entry describe the state **at the time it was written**.

They live here rather than under their own class heading because an index that carries a question and its
answer at once is a reader trap — the same reason a stale WATCH line was retired in the 0.5.0 window, applied to
the larger entries it left in place. **Saying it twice held it nowhere**: the governance section states the
same rule from the other side, and entries closed after this section was written kept accumulating under
`### READY-PATCH` and `### WATCH / ACCEPTED / DECLINED / BUILT` regardless — struck through, complete with
their answers, under headings a reader consults to ask what is left to do. They are moved here, verbatim and
in the order they sat in, and `a_closed_entry_does_not_stay_under_a_live_class` now decides the property
instead of two paragraphs asserting it. Neither the class nor the number is restated collectively: each
retained entry carries its own `Class:` line, and a count here would go stale the next time an item
closes — which is how the previous two sentences came to say "DESIGN-BREAKING" and "six" about a section
that also holds a closed READY-PATCH record.


- ~~**Three spec requirements the shell-to-Rust migration orphaned.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window via
  `fix/close-the-migration-orphans`. All three landed: `governance-dogfood`'s focused-matrix requirement
  removed, `reference-integrity`'s fixture-policy requirement restated as what the port does, and its
  boundary-family requirement rebuilt as a derivation held both ways by
  `crates/shengmo/tests/family_coverage.rs`. The entry is kept verbatim below because two of its own claims
  were wrong and the corrections are the part worth not re-deriving: it called the work "one OpenSpec
  lifecycle" for a lifecycle this repository has never run, and it promised a `## Subject` guard that already
  existed and would not have caught these anyway.

- **Three spec requirements the shell-to-Rust migration orphaned.** *Class:* READY-PATCH. *Observed
  pressure:* a contributed adversarial review found two; a sweep run to decide their shape found the third.
  *Observation source:* each of the twelve shell files the shell-to-Rust migration deleted, mapped to the spec requirement it
  implemented — nine were correctly swept when they were deleted, three were not. *Current reaction or
  bound:* none; each states a live `SHALL` that nothing runs, which is the failure this whole family exists
  to end, committed inside its own governance.
  - `governance-dogfood`'s focused-matrix ordering requirement and its three scenarios — **REMOVE**. The
    decision was made and recorded in the 0.5.0 window, in `dod_coherence.rs`'s doc comment and in the retired
    remediation queue; it never reached the spec.
  - `reference-integrity`'s fixture-policy requirement and its three scenarios — **REVISE**. The capability
    changed shape rather than vanishing: the port parameterises `offences_in` directly instead of accepting
    a fixture-set option, and `GOVERNANCE_DOCUMENTS` is a compile-time `const`.
  - `governance-dogfood`'s boundary-family coverage requirement and its two scenarios — **REVISE + BUILD**.
    Measured: every family it names does have an adopter-shaped owner today, so the substance holds and the
    gap is that nothing would notice one losing its owner. Build it **derived both ways** — families from
    the boundary types, owners from the examples and the self-law — never as a hand-kept inventory. Drop its
    stale `0.2.x` anchor and its unrelated `GovernanceTest` clause. *(This entry also claimed an asymmetry —
    that `AsyncExposureBoundary` was owned only in `sans-io-pure`'s `tests/reaction.rs` and not in its
    `src/governance.rs` like every sibling. **False, and corrected when it was checked rather than grepped:**
    `Constitution::sans_io_pure` constructs an `AsyncExposureBoundary` internally, so that example does
    declare the family on its imitable surface, through the profile. What the observation really found is a
    limit of the coverage reaction, filed as WATCH below.)*
  *Risk:* a reader consulting a spec is told a rule is enforced when it is not — the same class the bound
  register was built to end one level down. *Promotion trigger:* fired; this is the work, not a candidate
  for it. One branch and one pull request, because each orphan needs the same decision made per orphan
  rather than three separate repairs.

  **This entry claimed a guard would have caught two of them, and that was wrong too.** The guard named —
  every spec's `## Subject` resolving to tracked paths — **already exists** as
  `capability_subjects::declaration_offences`, held by `every_capability_declares_the_subject_it_governs`,
  and it was green the whole time: all three orphans' subjects resolve perfectly well while a requirement
  under them described a deleted mechanism. Specifying it as new work would have rebuilt a live reaction.
  What actually found them was reading each shell file the migration deleted and asking which requirement it
  had implemented — a judgement over prose. **No reaction is proposed for this class**, because deciding
  whether a prose-described mechanism still exists is the instrument this repository has measured and
  rejected three times. The residual is stated instead: a requirement can outlive its mechanism, and only a
  reader comparing the two will see it.

  **This entry said "one OpenSpec lifecycle" and that was wrong about this repository.** Measured: the
  `explore → propose → apply → sync` lifecycle `AGENTS.md` then described has **never run here** — zero
  `docs(openspec): propose`/`sync` commits in the whole history, and `openspec/changes/` untouched since
  `0.1.0`, which is when its `.gitkeep` was added. The `v0.4.0..0.5.0` window edited
  `openspec/specs/*/spec.md` in 151 commits, every one an ordinary `fix:`/`feat:`/`docs:`. `READY-PATCH` is a
  **compatibility class** in this file's own definition above, not a process exemption, and conflating the
  two is what produced the wrong claim. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate.
  *Authority:* `governance-dogfood` and `reference-integrity`.

- ~~**A bare trait name may not resolve against a same-module trait, contrary to the bound's own wording.**~~ **CLOSED** in the
  open window, in two steps, and the second is the one the record has to carry. The probe confirmed the gap: a
  bare principal trait declared in the governed module resolved to nothing when no `use` named it, so a
  boundary forbidding it did not react. The first fix resolved **every** unresolved single-segment principal
  to `{module}::{name}`, which over-reached in one direction and under-reached in the other — a bare name the
  module does not declare (a prelude trait, a glob import, a name the file never mentions) was fabricated into
  the module and reacted against a path that module never had, while a raw identifier was left as
  `crate::m::r#type` and never matched the canonical `crate::m::type` every other resolution site produces.
  What stands now: the fallback fires only for a name present in the **branch-local type namespace**, carried
  on `FileExternScope` (which already computed it for `externs_type`), and the segment is canonicalized with
  `strip_raw` first. `BareFallback::CurrentModule` is deliberately not used — it resolves without proving the
  name exists, which is the over-reach that was removed. Defended by four guards, two per capability: the
  re-pointed `dyn_operand_genuinely_unresolvable_bare_principal_is_a_bound` and
  `impl_trait_operand_genuinely_unresolvable_bare_principal_is_a_bound` (now forbidding the module-qualified
  spelling, which is what makes them observe the drop rather than a spelling mismatch), and
  `dyn_operand_bare_raw_identifier_local_trait_resolves_canonically` with its impl-trait twin. Version class:
  **minor**, as this entry's own promotion line predicted for a false-negative closure — see *Version
  horizons*.

- ~~**Five declared bounds have no pinning test.**~~ **CLOSED** in the
  open window. Closed by writing unit tests for all 5 remaining UNPINNED scenarios across `external-crate-confinement`, `runtime-origin-assertion`, and `semantic-dyn-trait-boundary`, bringing `unpinned` count to 0.

- **`crates/kanhe/tests/reference_integrity.rs` has no companion failure matrix.** *Class:* READY-PATCH,
  reopened. Previously marked CLOSED here as of the open window, on the claim that
  `crates/kanhe/tests/reference_integrity.rs` gained a throwaway git-repository fixture proving every
  refusal (exit 1 and exit 2) and pass direction. **That closure named the wrong subject and does not hold
  at `HEAD`.** The fixture described was the shell era's throwaway test companion to its
  `reference_integrity` gate script, added in the shell era — both deleted by the shell-to-Rust migration when `scripts/`
  migrated to Rust. *Observed pressure:* the current `crates/kanhe/tests/reference_integrity.rs` (1,300+ lines) has
  no `git init` fixture, no exit-code matrix, and never uses `kanhe::refusal::Kind`; its `scratch()` helper
  builds plain temp directories for unit-testing isolated parsing subroutines, not a fixture repository
  driving the gate's own pass/violation/cannot-judge behaviour against itself. *Observation source:* direct
  inspection of the file at `HEAD`: no `git init` fixture, no exit-code matrix, and no use of
  `kanhe::refusal::Kind`. Each is re-derivable by reading the file, which is what this rests on — the
  addition and deletion were cited by development commit until this sweep, and those resolve in no fresh
  clone. *Current reaction or bound:* none.
  *Promotion trigger:* the fix this entry previously claimed, actually done — a fixture-driven
  exit-1/exit-2/pass matrix for the current Rust gate. *Version class:* tests only; no published surface.
  *Authority:* this entry's own prior (incorrect) closure, which an adversarial contract review over
  `v0.4.0..HEAD` refuted by reading the file rather than the claim.

- ~~**Owner-label identity collapses across a cfg-collided self-type alias.**~~ **CLOSED** in the
  0.4.0 window, after an independent review re-derived it. Closed by refusing to name the ambiguity
  rather than by inventing an encoding for it: an owner role whose head admits more than one distinct
  candidate now reaches the shared fail-loud identity gate (a constitution error, exit 2, naming the
  `#[cfg]` collision), because neither candidate may be preferred and the candidate SET is identical
  for both colliding sites, so nothing available separates them. "Cannot judge" over a silent collapse
  is the Core Contract's own ordering. The single-candidate `resolve_path` that fed every such label
  was **deleted**, not merely bypassed — `resolve_path_all` is now the only resolver, so a caller
  needing one value must decide what to do about `len() > 1` instead of receiving an arbitrary pick,
  and the defect class is unrepresentable rather than fixed at three sites. `semantic-signature-coupling`
  gains the requirement and two scenarios. The original entry is kept below for its reproduction record.

- **Owner-label identity collapses across a cfg-collided self-type alias.** Class:
  DESIGN-BREAKING. Observed pressure: reproduced by the maintainer during round-3
  adversarial review of `change/hunyi-cfg-branch-use-reexport-merging` —
  two genuinely independent violations sharing one cfg-collided self-type alias
  (`#[cfg(unix)] use crate::a::Foo as X; #[cfg(not(unix))] use crate::b::Bar as X;`,
  each arm implementing the same governed trait) render the identical single-candidate
  owner label and collapse to one finding under exact-identity dedup, across
  trait-impl-locality, forbidden-marker, unsafe-confinement, and signature-coupling at
  once. Observation source: that review's reproduction, described above. Current bound:
  `canonical_self_owner`/`canonical_self_owner_without_fallback`
  (`crates/hunyi/src/resolve/shape.rs`) and `canonical_unsafe_owner`
  (`crates/hunyi/src/scan/unsafe_sites.rs`) each render a label from a single resolved candidate,
  cfg-blind, feeding straight into a dedup key. Risk: a real, enforce-severity
  violation is silently lost whenever this exact cfg-collision shape occurs — a false
  negative, the one bug class PROJECT.md's Core Contract forbids outright — but the
  trigger (a cfg-gated self-type alias reused across cfg-exclusive impls of the same
  governed trait/type) is narrow and has not yet been observed outside adversarial
  probing. Promotion trigger: either a redesigned owner identity that stays injective
  across cfg-ambiguous candidates, or a different anti-collapse key not fed by a
  single-candidate renderer — real design work, not a mechanical multi-candidate swap
  (explicitly scoped out of that change as its own follow-up). Version class:
  DESIGN-BREAKING (an injective owner identity almost certainly changes baseline
  `finding_key` shape for every affected capability). Authority: `PROJECT.md`'s
  violation-identity decisions, that change's commit body (which names this exact gap and
  scopes it out as a follow-up).

- ~~**An absolute `#[path]` literal's identity still disagrees across checkouts when its target
  coincidentally lies under one checkout's own anchor.**~~ **CLOSED** in the 0.4.0 window — the last
  open identity gap. Closed by stopping the relativization rather than by threading provenance through
  a labeling decision: a file reached through an absolute literal keeps the path the literal wrote, in
  every checkout, and the flag is inherited by the files that target reaches in turn. The recorded
  promotion trigger described the fix as threading "was this file reached via an absolute `#[path]`
  literal" through four functions, which read as a broad refactor and is why it sat; it is not, because
  `Path::join` discards its receiver EXACTLY when the joinee is absolute, so the fact is knowable at the
  single line that resolves the literal and only has to ride alongside the `(file, base)` pair the walk
  already carries. The test that pinned the gap failed with EQUAL identities the moment the flag landed
  — its own doc had said that is what closure would look like — and is replaced by one asserting it;
  the test that pinned "relativized when inside the anchor" is inverted, that behaviour having been the
  gap's mechanism. `runtime-origin-assertion` gains the rule and drops the two scenarios describing the
  old behaviour. The original entry is kept below for its reproduction record.

- **An absolute `#[path]` literal's identity still disagrees across checkouts when its
  target coincidentally lies under one checkout's own anchor.** Class: DESIGN-BREAKING.
  Observed pressure: found during round-2 adversarial review of
  `change/louke-unauditable-probe-relative-identity`, which closed the
  general relative-path case but left this one already-non-portable construct
  unresolved. Observation source: pinned regression test
  `a_nested_absolute_path_literal_still_disagrees_across_checkouts_a_known_residual_gap`, which failed
  with EQUAL identities the moment the fix landed and is replaced by
  `a_nested_absolute_path_literal_now_agrees_across_checkouts`
  (`crates/louke/src/audit/tests.rs`). Current bound: `strip_prefix` succeeds by pure
  textual match wherever an absolute `#[path = "/…"]` literal's target happens to share
  the anchor's prefix, producing a relative-looking label in that checkout and falling
  back to the raw absolute path in another — the two checkouts' `unauditable-probe`
  identities differ. Risk: narrow — an absolute `#[path]` literal is already
  non-portable and machine-specific by construction; this only affects that one already
  fragile idiom, not the realistic relative sibling-share case that change fixed. Promotion
  trigger: threading "was this file reached via an absolute `#[path]` literal" through
  the whole `resolve_path_module`/`external_module_files`/`collect_scope_modules`/
  `collect_reachable_probes` pipeline so such a file's label is never relativized at
  all — a separate, scoped refactor. Version class: DESIGN-BREAKING (changes
  un-auditable-probe identity shape for this construct). Authority: that change's commit
  body. The bound was also stated in `crates/louke/src/finding.rs`/`audit.rs`'s own doc comments and in
  `openspec/specs/runtime-origin-assertion/spec.md`; all three now state the CLOSED rule instead (an
  absolute literal is never relativized), so this record's description of the old behaviour is history,
  not a description of any current surface.

- ~~**`InherentGenerics` seam identity has no per-block distinguisher WITHIN one module.**~~ **CLOSED**
  in the 0.4.0 window. The seam now carries the **bounded thing** each exposure sits on — a parameter's
  own name, or a where-predicate's rendered bounded type — so two blocks in one module bounding
  different parameters to the same forbidden type are two distinct facts. The distinguisher this entry
  called a design decision is resolved by taking the one the codebase already had: it is keyed exactly
  like a trait `impl`'s own `where` position, and both now come from one shared walk over an impl's
  generics positions, so the vocabularies cannot drift. An impl-block **ordinal** was ruled out rather
  than chosen against, since `semantic-signature-coupling` forbids identity resting on scan order or
  item ordinal.
  What remains is a limit, not a gap, and is stated in the seam's own doc: two blocks whose bounds are
  *textually identical* still resolve to one seam. Nothing structural distinguishes them — their
  contents carry their own seams and position is forbidden — so two blocks bounding the same parameter
  to the same forbidden type state one architectural fact twice, exactly as one import on two lines is
  one violation. Completeness of the position walk rests on a language rule verified against a real
  `rustc` rather than assumed: an `impl`'s generic parameters cannot carry defaults, so a parameter
  contributes only its bounds (or, for a const parameter, its type). The original entry is kept below
  for its reproduction record.

- **`InherentGenerics` seam identity has no per-block distinguisher WITHIN one module.**
  Class: DESIGN-BREAKING. Observed pressure: verified real during
  0.4.0 sweep cleanup (2026-08-02/03) — two separate inherent impl blocks on the same
  type, each exposing the same forbidden subject through a different where-clause
  bound, collapse to one violation. Observation source: direct reproduction against
  `hunyi::check` (`crates/hunyi/src/collect/exposure.rs`'s inherent-generics collector) —
  described above. Current bound: `PublicSeam::InherentGenerics` is keyed on
  `{module, owner}`. The **cross-module** half of this entry is CLOSED — the module role was
  added in the 0.4.0 window, after an independent review re-derived it, and the adjacent doc
  comment that wrongly claimed owner-qualification alone kept the seam "distinct... from
  another block's generics" was corrected in the same change. What remains is strictly
  narrower: two impl blocks for the same owner **in the same module** still resolve to one
  seam, since owner-plus-module distinguishes where an impl is written, not which block it is.
  Risk: a false negative on a narrow idiom (two inherent impl blocks on one type in one
  module, each with its own where-clause bound exposing a forbidden type) — not yet observed
  as adopter pressure. Promotion
  trigger: a real per-block distinguisher added to `PublicSeam::InherentGenerics` — real
  design work, and constrained rather than open: `semantic-signature-coupling` forbids
  identity from resting on "scan order, item ordinal, and renderer fallback position", so an
  impl-block ordinal is NOT available as the distinguisher and a stable structural key (a
  rendering of the block's own generics, say) has to be designed and its collision behavior
  argued. Version class: DESIGN-BREAKING. Authority: this entry's own reproduction record
  (above); `openspec/specs/semantic-signature-coupling/spec.md`'s ordinal prohibition for the
  constraint on the trigger.

- ~~**Trait-impl-locality's violation target/rule-key reads the constitution's declared trait
  spelling instead of the already-resolved canonical anchor.**~~ **CLOSED** in the 0.4.0 window, after
  an independent review re-derived it. Both roles are now keyed on the resolved anchor, threaded out of
  the function that already computed it rather than recomputed (a second resolution site could
  disagree with the one that decided the matches). The multi-candidate question this entry named as the
  reason it was design work is answered by refusing rather than picking: a declared anchor whose
  re-export closure reaches more than one distinct local trait DEFINITION is a constitution error
  naming the candidates, since the ambiguity is in the declaration and choosing would make the
  governed target arbitrary. A declaration that already names the defining path — the ordinary case —
  is unchanged, so the fix churns only the baselines it must. `allowed_locations` deliberately stays in
  the rule key (it keeps two boundaries on one trait distinct) and the in-code comment that wrongly
  claimed it was NOT identity-bearing is corrected: `ViolationId` compares `rule_key` in full.
  `semantic-trait-impl-locality` gains all three rules and two scenarios. The original entry is kept
  below for its reproduction record.

- **Trait-impl-locality's violation target/rule-key reads the constitution's declared
  trait spelling instead of the already-resolved canonical anchor.** Class:
  DESIGN-BREAKING. Observed pressure: verified real during 0.4.0 sweep cleanup
  (2026-08-02/03) — declaring the identical boundary via two different (but
  re-export-equivalent) spellings of the same trait produces two `ViolationId`s for the
  same real-world fact. Observation source: direct reproduction against
  `hunyi::check_trait_impl_locality` — described above.
  Current bound: `target`/`rule_key` in `crates/hunyi/src/trait_impl.rs` are built from
  `canonical_path_str(&boundary.trait_path)` — raw-identifier stripping only, never
  re-export resolution — even though the same function already computes a
  re-export-resolved `true_anchors`/`canonical` value for match-decision purposes,
  unused for identity. Risk: real baseline-stability consequence — renaming a
  constitution declaration from a re-export spelling to the canonical spelling (a pure
  refactor, no code behavior change) silently flips every affected violation's identity
  and defeats the baseline. Promotion trigger: thread the already-computed resolved
  anchor into `target`/`rule_key` instead of the raw declared string — real design work,
  since `true_anchors` is a cfg-blind multi-candidate set and picking one deterministic
  canonical member for identity purposes is itself a design decision. Version class:
  DESIGN-BREAKING. Authority: this entry's own reproduction record (above).

- ~~**`OriginEntry`'s public constructor lets any code in the process assert an arbitrary runtime
  origin, defeating origin-based fail-closed confinement.**~~ **CLOSED** in the 0.4.0 window, by the
  `louke-origin-derived-from-type` change. Closed by removing the caller's input rather than by
  guarding it: the expansion target is now generic over the registered type and takes **no
  arguments**, so an entry's whole content is a function of that type and an origin the type does not
  have is unrepresentable. The original entry is kept below for its reproduction record and for the two
  dead ends it cost, both of which were recorded as viable before being tested.

- **`OriginEntry`'s public constructor lets any code in the process assert an arbitrary runtime
  origin, defeating origin-based fail-closed confinement.** (Spelled `OriginEntry::new` when this
  entry was written; renamed `__from_register_origin` and made argument-free in the 0.4.0 window.)
  Class: DESIGN-BREAKING.
  Observed pressure: verified real during 0.4.0 sweep cleanup (2026-08-02/03) — a
  hand-built `OriginEntry::new(TypeId::of::<RogueAdapter>(), "loukehot::good", "RogueAdapter")`
  passed to `install` alongside genuine `register_origin!` entries produces zero
  reaction for a seam declared `.only_origins(["loukehot::good"])`, even though
  `RogueAdapter` never legitimately registered that origin. Observation source: direct
  reproduction against the real `louke::install`/`assert_boundary!` public API, and later an in-tree
  test (`a_forged_origin_silently_passes_a_seam_its_type_may_not_cross`, since removed with the
  gap it pinned) that reproduced the same
  silent pass through the registry the way `install` builds it, then stopped **compiling** when the
  closure landed — that transition being the evidence, not a passing assertion.
  Risk: HIGH — it defeated the crate's core stated
  guarantee outright for any code sharing the process, not merely a narrow idiom;
  unlike the other entries here, it was a capability gap in the trust boundary
  itself, not an identity-collision edge case.
  **Two recorded promotion triggers turned out not to work, and both were recorded before being
  tested** — the lasting lesson of this entry. (a) `pub` → `pub(crate)` on the constructor breaks the
  legitimate `register_origin!` path, since `macro_rules!` visibility is checked at the expansion site.
  (b) A `#[track_caller]`/`std::panic::Location` redesign yields a *file path* where an origin's whole
  vocabulary is a module path. (c) A **proc-macro** does not help either: it is expanded into its
  caller's crate and resolved there exactly as a `macro_rules!` is, so a private constructor fails with
  `error[E0603]` at the adopter's own call (three-crate probe). All three share one shape — hunting for
  a macro that can pass something hand-written code cannot. No such macro exists, which is why the
  closure had to stop taking the origin from the caller at all. A backlog entry naming a fix that
  cannot be built is worse than one naming none: the next reader spends the budget before finding out.

- ~~**Only the ONE resolved crate root of a package is governed; its other compiled roots are not
  observed at all.**~~ **CLOSED** in the 0.4.0 window. Every compiled root is now its own corpus in both
  static dimensions, and an observation carries the compilation unit it came from as an identity role, so
  the same violation in two roots stays two facts rather than one that masks the other.
  Three measurements changed the shape of the work and are worth keeping: 漏刻 ALREADY governed every root
  (`member_root_files`, in production), so this was two dimensions diverging from a third rather than a
  family-wide bound — correcting this entry's own earlier claim that the scope question was shared because
  渾儀 uses the same single-root function, which was true of 渾儀 and never checked against 漏刻; a spike over
  the existing machinery passed all but one of 圭表's tests, so the corpus model tolerated N roots and the
  remaining work was identity, not a rewrite; and a target's NAME turned out not to be unique within a
  package (this repository builds a `lib` and a `bin` both named `tianheng`), so the role is the root's
  path relative to the package directory.
  Two things the work found that the entry had not predicted: a sibling conventional root leaks into every
  other root's walk (a top-level `lib.rs`/`main.rs` is `crate` in each), which without exclusion reported
  one violation once per root — a duplicate worse than the false negative being closed; and a per-root
  loop that deferred ANY error swallowed genuine scan failures whenever a sibling root happened to be
  governable, which is a silent pass. Both are fixed and pinned. The original entry is kept below for its
  reproduction record.

- **Only the ONE resolved crate root of a package is governed; its other compiled roots are not
  observed at all.** Class: DESIGN-BREAKING. Observed pressure: promoted in the 0.4.0 window from a
  single-lens WATCH hypothesis and a one-line `ACCEPTED DEBT` mention ("multi-target conventional-path
  conflation"), both of which understated it. Measured through three independent lenses:
  (1) **mechanism** — `xingbiao::crate_root_file` returns the first library-kind target, else the first
  `bin`, one root by construction, and 圭表's `package_src_dir` plus reachability walk both start there;
  (2) **minimal shape** — a package of exactly `src/lib.rs` + `src/main.rs` with the identical offending
  construct in both files and a boundary on `crate` reports ONE violation, in `lib.rs`;
  (3) **broader shape** — `src/main.rs`, `src/bin/conventional.rs`, a `[[bin]] path` inside `src/`, and
  a `[[bin]] path` outside it are all unobserved when a library root exists. Observation source: those
  measurements, pinned in both directions (the resolved root reacts; the others are silent; a
  library-less package governs its first `bin`) by what is now
  `crates/guibiao/tests/per_target_corpus.rs` — renamed and inverted when this entry was closed, since
  the transition those assertions existed to detect is what happened.
  Current bound: stated in `module-boundary`'s single-governed-root requirement, replacing a
  requirement whose premise — "both crate roots (`lib.rs` and `main.rs`) resolve to `crate`" — was
  factually wrong, and whose recorded limitation (a cross-root same-named submodule) was a narrower
  story than the truth. Risk: HIGH by class, and it lands on the most ordinary Rust package shape — a
  library beside its binary. A real violation written in `main.rs` passes silently, which is the one bug
  class the Core Contract forbids; what limits it in practice is that the governed root is usually where
  the architecture lives, and that a boundary an adopter declares on `crate` still reacts to everything
  the library reaches. Promotion trigger: **per-target module graphs**. Two roots of one package both
  denote module path `crate`, so observing both raises a violation-identity question the current model
  does not answer (which `crate` a finding names) — the same reason the requirement this replaces
  already named it an amendment beyond the conventional-path scanner. Note also that 渾儀 resolves roots
  through the same `crate_root_file`, so the scope question is shared rather than 圭表-local. Version
  class: DESIGN-BREAKING (a per-target corpus changes which facts exist, and plausibly their target
  role). Authority: `openspec/specs/module-boundary/spec.md`'s single-governed-root requirement and its
  two scenarios; the pinned test above.

- ~~**An inbound rule's target match is namespace-blind, so a name declared in two namespaces at once is
  observed only as its module.**~~ **CLOSED** in the 0.4.0 window. Closed by observing the value
  namespace, not by unioning both readings — the entry's own "deliberately NOT" still holds, and that is
  what keeps `shallow_inbound_rules_protect_only_the_exact_module` passing unchanged: an import reacts
  only when the anchored module really declares a `fn`/`const`/`static` of that final segment, so an
  ordinary `use m::child;` naming only a module stays silent.

  The promotion trigger asked for "a value-namespace item observation for the anchored module" as though
  it had to be built. **It already existed**, one module away: `symbol_scan`'s definition collector reads
  every module's own top-level `fn`/`const`/`static` from declaration-cleaned source, with the
  true-inline-module keying and module-top-level-only disciplines already worked out for the
  strict-external local-precedence ladder. The trigger was a missing *connection*, not a missing
  capability — the same misjudged cost as the absolute-`#[path]` entry earlier in the 0.5.0 window, whose
  trigger read as a four-function refactor and turned out to be one line. Worth recording as a pattern:
  a promotion trigger written from inside the code that lacks the observation tends to describe building
  it rather than looking for it.

  The residual is now the observation rather than the resolution, and is narrower than the entry's own
  note: a value declared inside a macro body or arriving through a re-export is unobserved, matching
  every other declaration reader in the dimension, and directs the reaction toward the module reading —
  the pre-existing behaviour, not a new gap. `rule-model-surface` states it with two scenarios, and the
  pinned test is inverted rather than deleted (`shallow_inbound_target_match_observes_the_value_namespace`).
  The original entry is kept below for its reproduction record.


- **An inbound rule's target match is namespace-blind, so a name declared in two namespaces at
  once is observed only as its module.** Class: READY-PATCH (the correction only adds reactions;
  no public API and no identity shape changes). Observed pressure: raised by an independent review
  of the 0.4.0 window against `crates/guibiao/src/module_check.rs`'s `resolve_import_module`, then
  verified against **rustc** rather than reasoned — a crate declaring `pub mod foo;` and
  `pub fn foo()` in one module compiles, and a single `use crate::internal::foo;` in another module
  binds both bindings (the importer can call `foo()` *and* reach `foo::INSIDE` from that one
  `use`). Observation source: that build, plus the pinned test
  `shallow_inbound_target_match_is_namespace_blind_a_stated_bound`
  (`crates/guibiao/src/tests/symbol_confinement.rs`). Current bound: the resolver sees only the
  path, so it returns the longest reachable module — the module reading — and the value reading is
  unobserved. The two disagree only under `ScanDepth::Shallow` anchored at that module's own
  parent: the value reading reaches the anchored module and should react, the module reading
  resolves to the descendant and does not. Under `Subtree` both readings lie within the anchored
  module, so nothing is lost. Risk: LOW-but-real — a false negative, the one class the Core
  Contract forbids reacting silently in, confined to one exotic shape (a module and a value
  sharing a name in the protected module) in one depth cell. Deliberately NOT closed by reacting
  on both readings: that makes every ordinary `use m::child;` react under `Shallow`, contradicting
  `rule-model-surface`'s own exact-seam scenario — a narrow false negative must not be traded for
  a broad false positive. Promotion trigger: a value-namespace item observation for the anchored
  module (`fn`/`const`/`static` declared directly in it, inline `mod` bodies included), so both
  readings are unioned exactly when the ambiguity is real; note it carries its own bounds a
  macro-generated or `pub use`-re-exported `fn` would still escape, which must be stated with it.
  Version class: PATCH. Authority: `openspec/specs/rule-model-surface/spec.md`'s stated
  namespace-blind bound and its scenario; the rustc verification and pinned test above.

- ~~**A capability's declared subject does not reach every file whose change it should file, and the one
  declared false negative covering that was observed costing something.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window
  via `change/claim-dimension-adopter-surface-subjects`. `adopter-surface`'s declared `## Subject` now names
  all four `adopter_surface.rs` files — the composed shell's alongside `guibiao`'s, `hunyi`'s, and
  `louke`'s — and `capability_subjects.rs`'s unclaimed-file count dropped from 109 to 106 (claimed 286 to
  289), exactly the three this closes. An independent adversarial review confirmed the factual premise and
  found no other capability already claimed any of the three files. The bound this entry was filed against
  (`repository-checks/files-no-capability-claims-a-stated-bound`) is untouched and its reason still holds —
  this closed one instance the promotion trigger named, not the bound itself. *Class:* READY-PATCH.
  *Observed pressure:* `observation_bounds()` reached the public surface of three published crates in the
  `0.5.0` window, was advertised as the way to read a dimension's declared bounds without composing a run,
  and was named by no `adopter_surface.rs`. It was not an oversight that a sweep would have caught: the
  three dimension contracts are tracked files **no capability's declared subject claims**, so the filing
  join never had them in scope. `adopter-surface`'s subject named only the shell's three files.
  *Observation source:* `crates/kanhe/tests/capability_subjects.rs`, whose
  `files_no_capability_claims_are_reported_rather_than_implied_judged` prints the unclaimed count on every
  clean run — the figure is produced there and deliberately not repeated here. *Current reaction or bound:*
  the declared bound `repository-checks/files-no-capability-claims-a-stated-bound`, an `UnderReacts` with
  `Owner::Engine`. Its stated reason is that requiring subjects to tile the repository would buy coverage
  with a claim per capability nobody could defend, and that reason still holds. *Risk:* a member of a
  published promise reaching `0.5.0` unheld — realised once already, closed for this member by naming it in
  the three contracts. *Promotion trigger:* a **second** distinct instance of a published surface member
  landing in an unclaimed file, or an adopter-visible defect traced to one. Tiling the repository is
  explicitly not the candidate; extending an **existing** capability's subject to the files it plainly
  governs is, and `adopter-surface` gaining the three dimension contracts is the worked example.
  *Compatibility class:* patch — the subject declarations and the filing join ship in zero packages.
  *Authority:* `openspec/specs/repository-checks/spec.md`'s *A capability SHALL declare the subject it
  governs* and the bound declared in `crates/kanhe/src/bounds.rs`.

- ~~**`observation-bound-register`'s own spec asserts a command's outcome that nothing runs.**~~ **CLOSED**
  in the open window via `fix/wire-openspec-validate-into-ci-dod`. `npx --yes @fission-ai/openspec@1.4.1
  validate --specs --strict` is now a line in both `AGENTS.md`'s Definition of Done and CI's `dod` job, so
  the claim the spec's own scenario made is now held by a reaction rather than by prose. Closing it also
  required a genuine fix, not only wiring: `repository-checks`'s own "The prelude promise SHALL be held
  against the contract compiled from outside" requirement failed strict validation because its opening
  sentence — the only line the validator's parsed `text` field reads — carried no SHALL/MUST keyword, even
  though the rest of the paragraph did; reworded the opening sentence to lead with the SHALL. *Class:*
  READY-PATCH. *Observed pressure:* the spec states `openspec validate --specs --strict` passes over every
  spec; measured, two did not, and `git grep` found the command named only in the scenario asserting its
  result — not in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, not in `AGENTS.md`'s Definition of Done, not in any script.
  `CHANGELOG.md`'s entry recording the measurement said this gap was closed by adding the command to both;
  it was not — corrected in the same edit that added this entry. *Observation source:* `git grep -n
  "openspec validate"` over the tracked tree at `HEAD`, one hit, in prose. *Current reaction or bound:*
  none — the scenario's claim is unheld by anything that runs. *Risk:* a spec passing `openspec validate`
  is a precondition the requirement corpus assumes and nothing defends; a spec that later fails validation
  would surface only if someone runs the command by hand. *Promotion trigger:* wiring `openspec validate
  --specs --strict` into `ci.yml` and the Definition of Done, pinned to a validator version — the fix this
  entry's own prose already claimed once. *Version class:* patch — a CI/DoD addition, no published
  surface. *Authority:* `openspec/specs/observation-bound-register/spec.md`'s scenario asserting the
  command's result.

- ~~**The construction-held list is hand-maintained prose.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window via
  `fix/construction-held-list-verification`, and by a cheaper route than the one this entry's own prose
  called for. The recorded plan was a perturbed build through `pin_bites.rs`'s mutated-worktree machinery,
  extended to carry a declaration whose subject is a spec sentence rather than a pinning citation. Reading the
  built-in composition path's own source instead answered the same question directly: for a construction-held
  dimension the built-in path does not call some function that happens to agree with the observer today, it
  *constructs that dimension's own `Observer` and calls `.observe()` on it* — one implementation to find, not
  two runs to compare. `crates/tianheng/src/runner.rs`'s `evaluate_constitution` was read to confirm this
  textually: the semantic and runtime arms each construct `SemanticObserver`/`RuntimeObserver` directly, and
  the static arm still calls `check_and_cover` without ever constructing `StaticObserver`. Added
  `the_construction_held_list_matches_the_built_in_composition_path`, and re-pointed the spec's scenario from
  `UNPINNED` to `PINNED-BY` it. Verified both negative directions: moving `SemanticObserver::new(...)` out of
  `evaluate_constitution`'s own body (into a sibling function it merely calls) fails the new test, and adding
  a `StaticObserver::new(...)` construction inside `evaluate_constitution` also fails it — restoring the real
  implementation passes both. *Class:* READY-PATCH. *Observed pressure:* `observer-protocol` requires the
  spec to say which dimensions' equality holds by construction, and nothing observed that the list was
  correct. The 0.5.0 window is the evidence: the list named runtime alone, the shell's semantic arm changed
  under it in the same window, and the list was repaired **by hand**. Falsifying it — say, claiming static is
  construction-held and runtime observed — passed the whole workspace suite and every gate. *Observation
  source:* the final sweep of that window, which ran exactly that perturbation. *Risk:* a reader takes a
  constructed equality for a measured one — the failure the requirement's own sentence exists to prevent, in
  the sentence that prevents it. *Promotion trigger:* fired; the list went stale inside the window that wrote
  it. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no crate. *Authority:* `observer-protocol`.

- ~~**Fixture scratch roots are claimed with `create_dir_all`, which adopts a pre-existing symlink.**~~
  **CLOSED** in the open window via `fix/shared-scratch-claim-helper`. The shared helper this entry called
  for now lives in `xingbiao` (the lightest-weight crate already depended on by `guibiao` and `hunyi`, and
  optionally by `louke`) rather than in `kanhe`, so it reaches every crate without amending `kanhe`'s
  dependency law: `xingbiao::claim_scratch` wraps `create_dir` with the same reasoning
  `kanhe::publish_source_gate::claim_scratch` already carried for its one production site, which is
  untouched — this closes the **test-fixture** instances, a different layer than the production gate the
  first instance was found in. Migrated 37 call sites across 24 files in all five crates (`guibiao`,
  `hunyi`, `louke`, `tianheng`, `kanhe`), leaving untouched every site that only builds a subdirectory
  *within* a root some other call had already claimed — that half was never the exposure. Added `xingbiao`
  as a `dev-dependency` to `tianheng` and `kanhe` (which lacked it; `guibiao`/`hunyi` already carry it as a
  regular dependency, and `louke` gained an unconditional dev-dependency alongside its existing
  `audit`-feature-gated optional one, so `cargo test -p louke` — audit OFF — can still reach it).
  `xingbiao`'s own test suite gained three cases, including a direct reproduction of the defect this closes:
  a pre-planted symlink that `create_dir_all` silently adopts and `claim_scratch` refuses. *Class:*
  READY-PATCH. *Observed pressure:* the Gate 8 review of the 0.5.0 window found it in
  `publish_source_gate::verify_tag_signature`, where the scratch holds `tag.sig` and `check_novalidate` reads
  it back — so a redirected directory let someone substitute a signature over the same payload made with
  their own key, in front of `cargo publish`. That site was closed by `claim_scratch` before this entry was
  filed. *Observation source:* a sweep of every `create_dir_all` in `crates/`, run when that fix landed:
  three harnesses already claimed their roots with `create_dir` and an `AlreadyExists` arm —
  `merge_workflow.rs`, `publish_workflow.rs`, `reference_integrity.rs`, which are the ones that put a
  controlled `bin/` on `PATH` — and roughly forty fixture roots across `guibiao`, `hunyi`, `louke`,
  `tianheng` and the remaining `kanhe` directions did not. *Risk:* bounded and unlike the closed production
  one — a redirected **fixture** root corrupts a test run on a developer's machine; it reaches no release
  artefact and no irreversible act. Measured on the machine this closed on: `create_dir_all` on a
  symlink-to-directory returns `Ok(())` and the writes land in the link's target, `create_dir` returns
  `AlreadyExists`, and `remove_dir_all` removes the link rather than following it — so every one of these
  was a race in a window, not a plant-and-wait. *Version class:* patch; repository-internal, shipping in no
  crate. *Authority:* `publish-source-integrity`, which paid for the first instance.

- ~~**`crates/kanhe/tests/release_coherence.rs`'s subshell reads have not been audited for a swallowed status.**~~
  **CLOSED** in the open window. Audited read by read rather than swept: four of the five consumers already
  carried a vacuity guard (the release spine, the crate-manifest set, and both example-pin counters), which
  is why the entry's MEDIUM risk did not materialise as a false clean. The fifth — the internal-pin loop —
  had none, so a reformatted `[workspace.dependencies]` table iterated zero times and the direction passed
  having asserted nothing about any pin; it now refuses with `2`.

  The audit found two things the entry did not predict, both worth keeping. The gate collapsed **violation**
  into **cannot judge**'s absence: every refusal was `1`, including a shallow clone, an absent manifest, and a
  moved crate layout, which the family contract forbids and this gate's own header (written one change
  earlier) already claimed it did not do. And the exit-contract backstop had **inverted** it — `fail` was a
  `return 1` relying on `set -e`, so the `ERR` trap turned every genuine incoherence into `2`. Neither was
  visible to CI, because this matrix asserted a non-zero status rather than a code. Every gate matrix now
  assert the code, which is the property that would have caught it.

- ~~**Two gates have no companion failure matrix.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window. Both now have one, and
  both were worth building rather than recording. `crates/kanhe/tests/whitespace_hygiene.rs` is the only fixture that pins
  the exit-contract backstop's subshell misfire — removing that guard fails it and no other matrix.
  `crates/kanhe/tests/dod_coherence.rs` closes the gate whose subject is a claim `AGENTS.md` makes about **itself**, so a
  reaction nobody had watched refuse was all that stood behind it; its zero-commands direction is the one that
  matters most, since without that guard the gate reports `ok: every local Definition of Done command (0
  parsed) is run by CI` and exits 0. Each gate gained the target-directory argument that makes a fixture
  possible, the same argument the register and reference-integrity gates already took.

  Every `check_*` gate now has a `test_*` twin, and every one of those matrices asserts the expected exit
  **code** rather than a non-zero status — the property whose absence let a 1-into-2 collapse ride green
  through CI in the release-coherence gate. The count is deliberately not written here: it is printed by
  the retired gate-shape projection, whose reaction enumerates the pairing.

- ~~**An observer cannot be made to declare what it does not observe.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window, and
  worth recording for what it did **not** buy as much as for what it did.

  `xuanji::Observer` has two methods and no default body on either, so a participant cannot be composed into a
  run without declaring its limits. The promise stops being a convention this family keeps about itself and
  becomes a property of the type — including for a third party this family never reviews. `tianheng::Run` folds
  eagerly, and 圭表, 渾儀 and 漏刻 each implement it, so it is dogfooded rather than offered.

  **What it does not buy, and this entry should not be read as claiming it:** the obligation is to *declare*,
  never to declare *completely*. A participant may answer with a partial list, or an empty one, and no reaction
  can enumerate the limits of a reaction it did not write. The fold likewise composes verdicts and does not
  adjudicate them. Both are declared bounds of `observer-protocol` rather than gaps left to be discovered.

  Two design decisions were **reversed by measurement**, both recorded because each looked principled. A third
  method — "identify your boundary kind" — was dropped because nothing reacts to it: a `Violation` already
  carries its kind, so restating it would be a second copy of one fact. And the heterogeneous set was to be a
  declared `dyn` exposure in the shell; measured, no module of `tianheng` is governed by a semantic boundary and
  the `dyn`-trait DSL has no allow-except form, so the declaration would have been a name with no reaction. The
  eager fold removes the exposure instead, and a grep-based assertion keeps it removed because 渾儀 is not
  watching that crate. **The lesson: a boundary declaration must be checked against the DSL that would have to
  carry it, not only against the architecture that motivates it.**

  A side effect worth keeping: the corpus-and-anchor derivation the shell computed for 漏刻 now lives in 星表,
  the single reader of truth, because a runtime observer would otherwise have derived it a second time — and it
  is **baseline identity**, which is precisely the twin drift that crate exists to prevent.

- ~~**The list of generated documents is prose, and nothing checks it.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window as the
  `projection-register` capability, and filed here in the same change that closed it because the trigger was that
  change's own last step: closing `gate-shape-contract` added a fourth projection **and** a hand edit to
  `AGENTS.md` to mention it, with no reaction behind the edit.
  `crates/kanhe/tests/projection_register.rs` enumerates the generated documents from the marker each carries,
  holds a two-way correspondence with the reactions blessing them, requires each to be named in `AGENTS.md`'s prose
  rather than inside a fence, and includes itself. Measured before proposing: 4 of 4 documents already carried the
  marker and named their generator, and the holders already agreed 4 for 4, so it described the tree.

  **Residual, declared rather than solved.** Two mechanisms are recognized — the shared Rust rule, and a `check_*`
  gate writing under `BLESS`. A document generated a third way whose author also omitted the marker is absent from
  both sides of the correspondence, which then holds over a surface missing a member. That is a declared false
  negative owned by the engine, not a limit of the corpus: the third mechanism's source sits in the tree the
  reaction already reads. Promotion trigger for closing it: a second generating mechanism actually existing. There
  is one today. The other residual is that a stated regeneration command is registered and never run, because
  running it means re-entering the harness already running or letting the reaction write into the tree it judges —
  `OutOfReach`, and not closable without giving up one of those two properties.

  **The lesson worth keeping is about reactions whose subject is text.** This apply hit self-reference three times:
  the specification quoting the marker it requires, the reaction's own source naming the signature it excludes, and
  the register having to be blessed twice to see itself. Every one was found by running it, none by reading it, and
  the fix was the same each time — recognize by position or shape, never by the bare string.

- ~~**A gate's own shape is convention, so every new gate re-learns it by breaking.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open
  window as the `gate-shape-contract` capability, whose reaction enumerated the
  tracked shell units under `scripts/` whose basename began with `check_` — on the basename rather than by a
  `check_*` pathspec, since git matches pathspec wildcards without `FNM_PATHNAME` and the glob would be
  describing something other than what it says — pairs each gate with the twin its basename names, asserts every
  checkable property, declares the three semantic classes and the coverage limit as observation bounds with
  pinning tests, and projects the retired gate-shape projection. A Rust reaction rather than a seventh shell gate,
  because `PINNED-BY` resolves only a harness-registered Rust function: a shell-defended capability would have
  landed those bounds `UNPINNED` and moved the register projection's leading figure off zero. It rides the
  existing `cargo test` line, so it added no Definition of Done entry and no CI step.

  **This entry's own claim was wrong, and worth recording as such.** It said the per-gate property table "is
  uniform **today** and enforced **nowhere**"; the second half held and the first did not. Measured while
  applying: the silent-clean-run assertion held in **2 of 6** twins — four grepped a clean run's stderr for the
  backstop's own diagnostic, which catches the one line it names — and the unchanged-repository assertion held
  in 5 of 6 by name and, once observed, in **none** of them, because every form captured `before` from a
  repository the gate had already run over, so a gate writing the same file on every run left it in `before` too.
  A stray write injected into a gate passed that direction unnoticed. The entry was wrong because it counted the
  properties it had just finished creating: the shape it described as settled was three weeks old — probed at
  `v0.4.0`, the backstop was installed in 0 of 4 gates and fixture-addressability in 1 of 4 — so the entry was
  reading its own recent work as convention. **The lesson: a promotion trigger written from inside the code that
  lacks the observation describes building the property, not finding it; measure the exact observation source
  before writing a figure into a trigger.**

  Both revisions the parked proposal needed were applied before it landed: the two qualifier phrasings left the
  heading slot, since what kind of stop a bound describes now belongs to `xuanji::Extent`; and the publish-time
  membership exemption left the bound mechanism entirely, because a bound says a reaction stops at a shape while
  an exemption says one named instance is excused from a requirement. **Residual, declared rather than solved:**
  nothing enumerates policy exemptions. The register enumerates bounds; this exemption is checked live by the
  reaction and named in the projection, and that is all. Trigger for giving exemptions their own register: a
  second instance. This is the first.

  **Retired two commits later, in the same window.** `gate-shape-contract` itself — the capability this entry
  closed with — was retired in the 0.5.0 window, once `scripts/` held nothing but `merge-pr.sh` and `publish.sh` and
  the capability's own projection read `0 gates, 11 properties each`: nothing left to pair, nothing left to
  enumerate. The pairing this entry describes, and every property and bound declared under it, no longer
  exists at `HEAD`. Recorded here rather than deleted, since the shape this entry closed — a gate's own
  convention, re-learned by breaking — is the part worth keeping; the capability that closed it is not the
  part that lasted.

- ~~**A swallowed subshell status was repaired nine times and could be written a tenth.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open
  window, and closed as a *shape* rather than as a tenth repair. `gate-shape-contract` gained an eleventh property:
  a gate may not consume an observation source through `< <(producer)` whose producer can fail.

  **Both failure directions are measured, which is what made the class worth a property rather than a habit.** A
  `git ls-files --eol` truncated after one clean row made `crates/kanhe/tests/whitespace_hygiene.rs` report
  `whitespace hygiene ok (1 tracked text files)` at **exit 0** over a repository it had read one file of — the count
  fell from two to one in its own output and nothing reacted to it. A `git log` truncated the same way made
  `crates/kanhe/tests/release_coherence.rs` conclude snapshot state and report `[Unreleased] must be empty` at **exit 1**, a
  violation invented from a partial read. A vacuity guard reaches neither: it was built for zero rows, and a partial
  read gives one or more. **The guard and the capture answer different questions, which is why they now sit side by
  side rather than one replacing the other.**

  Eight sites migrated to the shell era's shared capture library, and **the property found two more on its first run — one of them
  written by the migration itself** (`< <(sort …)`), the other a per-file scan never migrated at all. A property that
  catches its own author's fresh mistake within a minute of existing is the argument for having it.

  **The lesson worth keeping is about the helper, not the sites.** Its first version turned `grep`'s exit 1 — a clean
  miss, the ordinary case — into cannot-judge, and the release gate's own vacuity direction failed immediately. So it
  takes `--ordinary-empty <status>` per call site: the rule is about the producer's *contract*, not about its name,
  and the shell era's shared exit-contract backstop draws the same distinction for the same reason. A shared helper that decides a
  producer's contract for its callers would have been a new class of its own.

  **Residual, and the bound was narrowed rather than left standing.** A status swallowed by a command substitution,
  or by a pipeline's non-final stage, is still unobserved — detecting either would mean modelling whether the caller
  reads `$?` afterwards, which is control flow rather than text. The declared bound now says exactly that, with its
  heading untouched because the slug is its id. Also unreproduced: the `git ls-files | grep -q` SIGPIPE shape, which
  needs enough data to fill a pipe buffer; migrated with the class and recorded as migrated without a demonstrated
  negative run. Trigger for revisiting: a swallowed status found in a shape the property does not reach.

  **Retired with the rest of `gate-shape-contract`, in the 0.5.0 window.** The eleventh property, the shared capture
  library, and the `--ordinary-empty` per-call-site contract this entry describes were all part of the same
  capability, deleted whole once it reached the vacuity its own bounds warned about. Nothing at `HEAD` still
  asserts either failure direction measured above; a future instance of a swallowed subshell status would
  need a new reaction, not a resurrection of this one.

- ~~**The pre-publish gate had no specification, and its stated bound had the cause backwards.**~~ **CLOSED** in
  the open window as the `publish-source-integrity` capability. Found in the 0.5.0 pre-release review, and worth
  keeping for the shape rather than the fix.

  All 34 specifications were searched: **none** stated that a publish must come from a signed annotated tag at
  the tip of `main`. The gate standing before the one irreversible act carried its contract in its own header
  comment, while `gate-shape-contract` exempted it from Definition-of-Done membership *by name* — the one place a
  reader was told it is special. A reaction with no requirement is the mirror of the class the 0.5.0 window kept
  closing, and it has a consequence: there was nowhere to declare a bound.

  **The bound's stated cause was wrong, and that is why the defect survived.** The header said the signature could
  not be verified because verification needs an allowed-signers configuration CI lacks. Measured with no such file
  anywhere, `ssh-keygen -Y check-novalidate` verifies validity; only **attribution** needs the file. So the gate
  matched a shape — and accepted an unsigned tag whose message quoted a signature block. **The lesson: a bound's
  cause is what the next author reasons from. This one said "you cannot check this", so nobody tried.** A bound
  with a wrong cause is worse than one with no cause at all.

  This is the second live instance in one day of `observation-bound-model`'s own declared bound that *a
  declaration's stated cause is the real cause is not observed*. Two instances is the number worth naming:
  the extent is typed and checkable while the rationale is prose the model never reads, and both instances were
  found by a human-style review rather than by any reaction. Trigger for revisiting that bound: a **third**
  instance, or a proposal for a rationale check that is not a keyword heuristic.

  Also recorded: `PINNED-BY` resolving only a Rust function meant this shell gate's bound could be defended by a
  twin direction and cited by nothing. Rather than accept `UNPINNED` — which would have reported a defended bound
  as undefended, buying a true figure with a false fact — the release-repository fixture builder was extracted to
  `crates/kanhe/src/publish_source_gate.rs` and a Rust test pins the bound through it. **Measured, not estimated**: one
  shared builder, no second construction. So the WATCH entry on shell-defended capabilities stays WATCH; its
  trigger asks for a residual measured and found *unaffordable*, and this one was affordable.

- ~~**The 天衡 shell's baseline-writing and CLI surface has never been swept.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window,
  swept against an enumeration built first as the entry required, and it found **two defects — both in the
  requirements rather than in the code.**

  **The enumeration, and what it measured.** The baseline write path's twelve filesystem operations, read out of
  the code rather than guessed: `canonicalize` on the target, the mode read, the `O_EXCL` temp create, the
  temp-plant loop, `fchmod` on the *descriptor* rather than the path, `sync_all` after the mode and before the
  rename, the rename, the parent-directory flush whose error is deliberately discarded, the guard's cleanup on
  drop, and on the create path `create_new`, the `symlink_metadata` dangling-symlink diagnosis and `read_link`.
  Every one already has a test in `crates/tianheng/tests/baseline_cli.rs`. Five further adversarial shapes were
  probed live — absent parent directory, target is a directory, read-only parent, unreadable target, symlink to a
  directory — and all five exit 2 naming the path and the OS cause, with no silent success and no misdiagnosis.
  The create-versus-overwrite decision takes the create path on `NotFound` **only**, so an unreadable existing
  baseline cannot be misreported as a creation race. On the CLI side, twenty-five cells: four value-taking flags ×
  {missing value, empty, flag-shaped, empty in the equals form, repeated}, plus the boolean flags, the unknown
  flag and positional, and the `--format` value. **Swept and defended, except for one column.**

  **What it found.** `list`'s refusal named no flag — one sentence for all five check-only flags — while the
  requirement covering the same conflict inside `check` cites `list`'s rule as the one it extends *and* requires
  the flag to be named. Each implementation satisfied its own requirement, which is why no test caught it. And
  `list`'s requirement enumerated four check-only flags while the runner rejected five: `--disallow-stale` was
  added to the code and not to the prose. Corrected by tightening the requirement and deriving the set, so a sixth
  flag is covered the moment it exists.

  **Two of the sweep's own measurements were wrong before they were right**, recorded because the correction is the
  transferable part. The first CLI probe grepped the whole output for the flag name — and the `usage:` banner lists
  every flag by construction, so every cell measured as naming its flag, including a nonexistent one. The second
  read the `error:` line only. Separately, `list --format sarif` looked like it shared the generic message until
  the probe stopped passing `--manifest-path` alongside it, which was tripping the check-only guard first. **A
  probe that carries an unrelated flag is measuring that flag.**

  **Residual: the enumeration is hand-made and will rot.** It is a snapshot taken against a named revision, in a
  proposal that dissolves at sync, and nothing enumerates the CLI surface as a reaction — which is how this
  requirement's own list of four went stale in the first place. Not solved here: a register over six flags would be
  ceremony this finding does not justify. Promotion trigger: a **second** defect found in this surface, or a flag
  added to the runner without a test that names it.

- ~~**The 渾儀 seam-identity and owner-qualification surface has not been swept against the bound index.**~~
  **CLOSED** in the open window, swept and found defended — by a structurally enforced enumeration rather
  than by diligence, which is why the result is worth recording instead of just noting "no findings".

  `every_public_seam_shape_is_named_and_identity_injective` carries the enumeration and forces it to stay
  complete: `seam_kind` matches all eleven `PublicSeam` variants with no wildcard, so a new variant cannot
  compile without a representative; `SeamKind::ALL` is asserted duplicate-free; the observed shape set must
  **equal** it; the shape-to-label mapping is a bijection checked in **both** directions, so a new variant
  folded into an existing shape cannot read as covered; each seam's field schema is asserted exactly; and
  `keys.len() == seams.len()` asserts the injectivity the name claims. Thirty-eight further
  distinctness tests cover the owner-qualification half across the family.

  **ACCEPTED DEBT, stated by that test itself**: the *content* of each representative stays hand-maintained.
  A representative whose field values do not actually differ from a sibling's in the distinguishing field
  would satisfy the set equality and the bijection while proving nothing about that field. The test names
  this as a judgment no structure can force, and it is accepted rather than closed because the alternative —
  generating representatives — would need a model of which field distinguishes which shape, which is the
  judgment itself. It is not a bound and does not belong in the register: it limits a test's completeness,
  not an observation.

  Lesson kept, because it recurred four times in the 0.5.0 window: a gap suspected from a partial view dissolves
  on the full one. The injectivity assertion here was read as absent from a fifteen-line excerpt and sits on
  the sixteenth. Read the whole construct before reporting it, and diff what a change actually moves rather
  than reasoning about what it should.


- ~~**An inherited observation bound is RESTATED by each capability that inherits it, so one behaviour
  change leaves several specs stale at once.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open window. Closed by a reaction plus
  the repair it forced, not by choosing one of the three candidates the entry listed: they were framed as
  alternatives and are not — a reaction detects the restatement and the repair resolves it, and only the
  reaction stops the next one accumulating silently.

  The register made it measurable on its first projection: two behaviours were declared as bounds in three
  capabilities each, all six declarations citing one test. `crates/kanhe/tests/bound_register.rs` now fails when a test
  is cited by declared bounds in more than one capability, keyed on the shared citation rather than on
  statement text — two declarations of one behaviour do not have identical prose, so text similarity would
  be a heuristic where a shared citation is a fact. Repetition within one capability is not a restatement
  and does not fire it.

  The repair sank the declaration to `semantic-signature-coupling`, which its own spec already identifies as
  the owner by stating the anchor-and-item property on every single-module-anchored capability's behalf, and
  the other two now reference it. **Raising a shared surface into its own capability was rejected**:
  ownership already existed, so a new capability would have added a name without adding an observation.

  A settled decision was reversed deliberately and the reversal recorded: the register originally declared a
  shared bound once per capability, because declaring it once would leave the other specs silent about a
  bound they have. The reference form, which did not exist when that was settled, keeps the bound visible
  everywhere it applies while leaving one declaration to maintain, so the property the old rule protected is
  no longer bought at the price of restatement.

- ~~**WATCH: `AGENTS.md`'s OpenSpec lifecycle section describes a process with no instances.**~~
  **CLOSED** in the open window via `fix/declare-the-openspec-adoption-mode`. The diagnosis in the entry
  below was the second of three, and the third is the one that was acted on. Not *unrealized aspiration*
  and not *prose contradicted by practice*: **an adoption decision made from the beginning and written
  down nowhere.** OpenSpec offers a `specs` half and a `changes` half; this project uses the first, has
  never used the second, and `openspec/config.yaml` declared neither. So `AGENTS.md` described the mode not
  chosen, and a reader had nothing telling them it was a choice. The call is now in `PROJECT.md`'s
  Decisions with what would change it, and `AGENTS.md` states how a capability change is worked in the mode
  actually in use. `openspec/changes/archive/.gitkeep` **stays** — its job is now optionality rather than
  archive hygiene, so adopting the other half needs no exception — and nothing enforces the mode,
  deliberately, since a check that fired on a change directory would prevent that adoption.

  *Note, 2026-08-21: the mode this closure recorded was itself wrong, and the correction is in `PROJECT.md`'s
  Decisions. `has never used the second` was measured over the release spine and stated over the repository:
  `git log --all` reaches dozens of change directories, and this entry's own observation source — `openspec/changes/**`
  untouched since `0.1.0` — reads only what a release-spine checkout tracks. The closure's diagnosis
  survives it: the adoption decision was written down nowhere, and writing it down was right. Which mode got
  written is what the correction moves.*

- ~~**WATCH: a refusal site is defended only if some direction dies when its kind is swapped or its message
  sentinelled — and twenty-four are not.**~~ **Closed at the time** by the now-retired refusal mutation sweep,
  which turned the review technique into a repository check and, in doing so, corrected the entry: the
  twenty-four merged two populations a hand-run sweep cannot separate, because a perturbation kills nothing
  both when no direction distinguishes a site and when no direction reaches it. At closure it measured:
  `58 enumerated, 52 defended, 6 declared out of reach, 0 undistinguished, 0 unreached and unclaimed, 0 stale`.
  The residual was closed in order — fourteen sites constructed, two deleted as second reads of something the
  judgement already held, six declared with a slug joined in both directions to a bound. The mechanism was
  later retired when constructor locations were reclassified as implementation coverage rather than
  repository governance identities; focused behavior matrices retain the operator-facing evidence.

- ~~**WATCH: the rule shape the self-law relies on most is absent from `examples/`.**~~ **CLOSED** in the open
  window, by its own trigger firing and being noticed rather than by a decision to go looking. The trigger was
  *an example is added or revised for another reason, at which point the shape is chosen deliberately rather
  than by omission* — and `examples/observer-participant` was added mid-window while
  `grep -rc restrict_dependencies_to examples/` still returned zero. The shape had been chosen by omission one
  more time, and the entry existed to make that visible.

  `examples/guibiao-standalone` now declares a crate-level allowlist beside its module boundary. The landing
  site was not a free choice: that example's manifest already claimed its one-dependency footprint **is** the
  圭表 pitch, "demonstrated here rather than asserted" — a claim in a comment with no reaction, which is the
  open loop this project exists to close. Declaring it makes the pitch react.

  **The evidence a holding boundary needs is different, and that shaped the change.** A passing allowlist is
  indistinguishable from one reading the wrong thing, so `tests/reaction.rs` points the same shape at the same
  real manifest with the dependency excluded and requires it to name that dependency and gate. Measured
  separately, by adding a second dependency to the manifest and running the demo: the declaration in
  `governance()` reports it and exits 1.

  **Two figures in this entry had drifted before it closed**, which is the class the window spent itself on: it
  said the rule carries six of eleven self-law boundaries, and measured it is neither number. They are not
  replaced with corrected ones — the projection enumerates that set, and the property the sentence needed is
  that the rule carries *more of the self-law than any other*, which is true without arithmetic. *Version
  class:* patch; `examples/` ships in no crate. *Authority:* `governance-dogfood`, which owns the examples'
  reaction. **Still not claimed**, unchanged from the original entry: that enumerated denylists are wrong, or
  that the self-law avoids them. It does not — its inline-symbol-path confinements each carry an enumerated verb
  list, and `inline-symbol-path-confinement` declares the unlisted remainder as a bound the adopter owns.

- ~~**kanhe's TOML readers hand-parse a grammar `region::toml()` already tokenizes but does not structure.**~~ **CLOSED** by `refactor(kanhe): the inherit question is parsed`, which
  migrated the last hand-rolled TOML reader and deleted the layer beneath it. The entry is kept verbatim
  below because two of its own claims were wrong and the corrections are the part worth not re-deriving: it
  named `prelude_promise.rs`'s `block_body` as a TOML reader, and that function reads Rust and walks braces;
  and it never named `manifest::assignment`, which was the actual survivor. What closed it was a defect
  neither review nor reading found — a member inheriting through a `[package.version]` sub-table heading,
  which cargo resolves and a line-oriented reader cannot represent — measured against cargo rather than
  argued. One thing is left behind and is not this entry's: `region::Source::toml()` now has no production
  caller at all, only directions over the lexer itself, and whether a lexer mode with no reader should be
  retired is a question about `region` rather than about the readers this entry watched.

  *Class:* READY-PATCH. *Observed pressure:* `release_coherence_gate.rs`'s `declared_dependencies`,
  `package_name` and `require_lock_versions`, and `prelude_promise.rs`'s `block_body`, each route through
  `kanhe::region::Source::of(text).toml()` for comment/string-stripping but still hand-split the resulting
  lines for table and block structure. `crates/kanhe/tests/release_coherence.rs`'s own doc comments record
  the resulting bug class as a still-open well, not a closed one: a `[lib]` name-line preceding `[package]`
  misread as the package name, single- versus double-quoted TOML string values silently unreadable, a
  `[[patch.unused]]` table's fields bleeding into the `[[package]]` block above it because the block boundary
  was the literal string `[[package]]` and nothing else, a commented-out dependency line counted as a real
  pin, and a comment glued to a value with zero whitespace tripping an older lexer. *Observation source:* a
  `v0.4.0..release/0.5.0` review that also sampled the most recent 60 commits on `release/0.5.0` and found 46
  (78%) carrying `kanhe` in their Conventional Commit scope and 38 (64%) typed `fix` — this entry's TOML
  readers are the still-unclosed half of that pattern; the Rust-side half (`refusal_register.rs`,
  `observer_protocol.rs`'s body-extent reader) closed via syn as a `[dev-dependencies]`-only addition,
  requiring no self-law amendment because `restrict_dependencies_to` observes only `DependencyKind::Normal`
  by default. *Current reaction or bound:* none declared in any capability spec; the bugs above are recorded
  only in doc comments and `CHANGELOG.md` history, not in `openspec/specs/repository-checks/spec.md` as a
  stated bound. *Risk, bounded rather than assumed:* kanhe ships in no package (`publish = false`), so a
  misread here misfires only this repository's own release-coherence gate — never an adopter's build or a
  published artifact. *Promotion trigger:* unlike the Rust-side closure above, these four functions run from
  non-test `crates/kanhe/src/` code that the `release-coherence` production gate calls directly, so a real
  TOML parser (`toml` or `toml_edit`) would land in kanhe's `[dependencies]`, not `[dev-dependencies]` —
  crossing kanhe's declared dependency allowlist (`AGENTS.self-law.md`, rendered from `crates/shengmo/src/law.rs`)
  and requiring the self-law amendment ritual `crates/kanhe/tests/self_law_amendment.rs` records, with steward
  review per `.github/CODEOWNERS`. The trigger is that amendment being proposed and accepted — this entry does
  not promise a minor release until it fires. *Compatibility class:* patch; the correction itself ships in no
  crate, but the prerequisite amendment is an architectural change decided by the steward, not a code patch.
  *Authority:* this entry, `AGENTS.self-law.md`, `crates/kanhe/tests/release_coherence.rs`'s documented bug
  history.

  **The amendment fired and four of the readers are migrated. The fifth is scoped here rather than
  attempted again.** `toml_edit` entered `kanhe`'s allowlist through the ritual, and `workspace_version`,
  `package_name`, `require_lock_versions` and `publishable` now ask the parser. `declared_dependencies` does
  not, and the reason is its **consequences**, not its difficulty: the reader itself was written and the
  corpus confirmed every behaviour it changes is an improvement — a quoted key names its crate, an escaped
  path is compared, a duplicate key is the parse error cargo also gives.

  What it costs, measured on the attempt rather than estimated: **287 insertions against 1,168 deletions**,
  four enum variants made unconstructible (`Declared::Several`, `Package::Several`,
  `Package::FieldUnreadable`, `Package::KeyUnreadable`), **six refusal sites retired**, four unit directions
  deleted with their subject, one moved onto the new reader, two spec scenarios rewritten — and **ten
  integration directions each needing a judgement about what the right new answer is**, one of whose fixtures
  is itself invalid TOML the hand-rolled reader tolerated.

  *Why it is not split:* the four variants die together, the moment the reader stops constructing them. There
  is no slice that retires one state without the reader, and keeping the hand-rolled reader alongside the
  parser to stage it would be two readers of one question — the defect the entry is about. So it is one
  change, and it is a large one.

  *Promotion trigger, second half:* a session that can carry ten fixture judgements and a six-site retirement
  as its own piece of work. It was attempted at the end of one that had already landed four migrations, and
  stopped rather than finished, because the attempt had already produced one false green — a failure grep
  that could not see a test module which had stopped compiling. The reader is worth writing again from the
  measurement above; what it needs is room, not rediscovery.

  **That trigger fired and the reader landed; the list above is wrong in both directions, measured
  2026-09-02.** `declared_dependencies` asks the parser now, through
  `refactor(kanhe): the dependency grammar is parsed` — so does `package_name`, `require_lock_versions`,
  `workspace_version` and `publishable` — and the `Package` enum this entry said would die with it is gone
  entirely, variants and all. Two corrections follow, and neither is a detail:

  - **`prelude_promise.rs`'s `block_body` was never in scope.** The *Observed pressure* above names it among
    the readers that route through `Source::of(text).toml()` and then hand-split lines for table structure.
    It does not: it calls `.rust()` and walks braces to find a block body, and `.toml()` appears nowhere in
    that file's history. Whoever picked this entry up would have gone looking for a TOML reader that is not
    there.
  - **The survivor is `manifest::assignment`, which this entry never named.** It finds the `=` outside
    strings, splits the head, and walks the dotted segments by hand — and its own doc comment records
    *three rounds of one defect*, each round the boundary of *decoded* moved one segment right. The
    production gate reaches it from two call sites: the workspace-version inherit check, and the inline-table
    field reader beside it.

  **The fourth round is live, and it is the first of them found by measurement rather than by review.**
  A member may inherit through a sub-table heading — `[package.version]` with `workspace = true` — and
  cargo 1.96.0 resolves it, measured in a scratch workspace whose member declares exactly that and whose
  `cargo metadata` reports the inherited version. The inherit check walks lines asking each one whether it
  assigns `version`; a table heading assigns nothing, so no line answers, and the member is refused for not
  inheriting a version it does inherit. A false refusal — not the direction the Core Contract forbids, but a
  defect, and the same defect the three recorded rounds are, arriving through the one spelling a
  line-oriented reader cannot represent at all.

  *What the repair deletes rather than swaps, measured the same day:* `dotted(` and `unquoted(` are called
  only inside `manifest.rs`, and `outside_strings`, `split_outside`, and the gate's `inline_fields` and
  `offer_value` are local to their own files. A parsed document answers the inherit question in one
  expression over every spelling — the four this entry's history records, the quoted-inner form, and the
  sub-table form above — verified against `toml_edit` on all six together with five negatives before any of
  this was written down. So the remaining migration takes the hand-rolled TOML machinery out rather than
  standing a parser beside it.

  ~~**Two lists of `(String, String)` with different meanings flow through one function, and only the failure
  matrix can tell them apart.**~~ **BUILT — the trigger fired on both clauses at once.** Selecting the
  internal-pin subject by identity made `require_internal_pins` the third consumer *and* an edit to this
  sequence, and the swap stopped being latent: a unit direction handed the `(path, text)` manifests to a
  reader expecting members, compiled, and answered with a vacuity refusal instead of the site it observes.
  The two lists now have distinct types — a `Member` carrying the name against the `(String, String)`
  manifests — so the swap cannot compile; the compiler found two further sites where a binding named
  `manifests` held members. What follows is the entry as it was filed. `require_version_surfaces` takes the `(path, text)` manifests and returns the
  `(path, name)` pairs `require_example_pins` produced; `require_changelog_state` and the lock reader read the
  second. *Observation source:* a review opened Gate 4 on that function needing an *and then* to state its job,
  and proposed moving the two pin calls to the caller "since the `Vec<(String, String)>` return already exists
  for that". The move was made and reverted: the caller's `manifests` became the text list, and the lock check
  reported *Cargo.lock is missing workspace package* with a whole manifest where a name belongs. Nothing but
  the message assertions caught it. *Risk, bounded:* latent — today's flow is correct, and the swap is only
  reachable by editing this sequence. *The shape:* give the two lists distinct types, so the swap cannot
  compile and the Gate 4 rename becomes free. *Promotion trigger:* the next edit to this sequence, or a third
  consumer of either list. *Compatibility class:* patch; the gate ships in no crate. *Authority:* this entry.

  ~~**A second question about a table-body line is still answered in two places, and the general form is named
  here rather than built.**~~ **BUILT AND RETIRED THE SAME DAY IT WAS FILED.** The deferral rested on *both
  reach fail-closed answers today; the dependency reader refuses where it cannot decode* — true of a quoted
  **head**, and false of a quoted **tail**, which was dropped silently. A review measured it:
  `xuanji."path" = "xuanji"` beside `xuanji.version = "0.5"` is a path dependency at `^0.5` to cargo, and the
  reader answered *no path*, so the stale pin left the internal check's subject while one correct pin elsewhere
  satisfied its floor and the release reported clean. A **false negative** is not deferrable on a fail-closed
  premise, so `manifest::assignment` was built and the two sites the false negative ran through were converted:
  the dependency reader's **dotted** branch and the inline-table reader now decode every segment, and an
  undecodable key reports unreadable rather than absent. `a_stale_internal_pin_behind_a_quoted_tail_is_refused`
  holds it. *Authority:* this entry.

  **What is left of it, stated rather than implied.** Two key reads still decide their own: the bare-and-inline
  entry key in `declared_dependencies` (which hands its raw key to `Package::of`, so a quoted dependency key
  becomes `KeyUnreadable` — fail-closed, and **pinned** by
  `a_dependency_key_this_reader_cannot_decode_is_refused_rather_than_skipped` with its own spec scenario), and
  the lock reader — which was converted when its own ordering premise came due, so what remains is the
  bare-and-inline entry key alone. Converting the first would turn a
  visible cannot-judge into the answer cargo gives, which is better — and it inverts a pinned scenario, so it
  is not a release-eve edit. *Promotion trigger:* the next change to either reader, or an adopter manifest in
  the subject corpus spelling a dependency key non-bare. *Compatibility class:* patch.

  **Note — the paragraph above is closed, and every noun in it is gone.** The trigger fired: a real parser
  replaced the hand-rolled reader, so the entry key is decoded and its pin judged, which is the conversion the
  paragraph defers as *better* and *not a release-eve edit*. `Package::of` and its `KeyUnreadable` state no
  longer exist, and neither does
  `a_dependency_key_this_reader_cannot_decode_is_refused_rather_than_skipped` — the direction now sits under
  `a_quoted_dependency_key_names_its_crate_and_its_pin_is_judged`, and its scenario requires the decoding it
  used to forbid. Found by sweeping for the retired **test name** while repairing the specification the same
  migration left behind, not by the commit that did the converting: that commit described what it had just
  done and had no reason to know which deferral it had just closed. That is the shape `AGENTS.md` records
  under the retirement sweep, and this entry is one of its instances rather than an exception to it.

  **The surface grew by an escape decoder, and that was the cheaper of two wrong answers rather than a
  reversal of this entry.** `manifest::decoded` resolves the escapes cargo resolves in a table heading or a
  key. It was added because the alternative was measured and was worse: `cargo metadata` reads `serde` under
  `[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu."\u0064ependencies"]` and under `["dep\u0065ndencies"]`, so a reader that
  answered *undecidable* for a backslash left every pin in such a table unread while an ordinary pin beside it
  kept the aggregate guard satisfied — a silent false negative in the production gate, reproduced as a clean
  release in `an_escaped_dependency_table_heading_is_read_as_the_table_cargo_reads`. The promotion trigger
  above is a steward amendment ritual, which is not a thing to wait behind with a false negative open. The
  refusals that gave that reason kept their behaviour and changed the reason: a **value** carrying an escape
  (`manifest::quoted_value`) and a **non-bare dependency key** (`Package::KeyUnreadable`) both said *no
  decoder exists*, and both now say what actually separates them from a heading — a refusal there is visible
  to an operator. **That paragraph describes the hand-rolled reader, which a real parser has since replaced**
  (`refactor(kanhe): the dependency grammar is parsed`): `manifest::quoted_value` and the bare-key predicate
  it contrasted are both gone, and the parser answers the key question without either.

  **A third reader of the same class arrived, and it is on the cheap side of this entry's own dividing line.**
  `crates/kanhe/tests/merge_workflow.rs`'s `workflow_shape` reads `.github/workflows/ci.yml` line by line to
  hold the premise `require_ci_green` states to an operator. Seven consecutive adversarial review rounds each
  closed its finding and surfaced one more position in the same reader: the job-name indentation, the job-key
  indentation, the scope of the two trigger keys, the flow form at the top level, and the flow form one level
  down. Every repair was correct and every one was verified by a fixture row and a negative run; the count is
  the argument rather than any single miss. Two of the five failed **open** — the reader reported a premise
  intact over a workflow that carried a real path filter.

  **That severity has since been withdrawn, and the withdrawal is the useful part of this paragraph.** The
  premise existed because the wrapper's refusal asserted it to an operator; the classification never read the
  workflow at all. With that sentence removed the reader decides **when** an operator learns a job may skip,
  not **whether** — a skipping job reports `SKIPPED` and the wrapper refuses either way. So the two open
  positions cost minutes rather than admitting a merge, and a sixth would too.

  **What this entry establishes and the YAML case inherits:** the Rust-side half closed with `syn` as a
  `[dev-dependencies]`-only addition, needing no self-law amendment because `restrict_dependencies_to`
  observes `DependencyKind::Normal` by default. `workflow_shape` lives in `crates/kanhe/tests/`, so a YAML
  parser lands in the same table `syn` and `proc-macro2` already occupy. It is therefore **not** blocked on
  the amendment ritual this entry's TOML half is blocked on — the two halves have different prices, and only
  one of them was priced. *Promotion trigger for this third reader:* **a second file in
  `.github/workflows/`**, and not a sixth position in the reader. The severity above is per mechanism and only
  three of the five keys carry it unconditionally: `if:`, `needs:` and `continue-on-error:` move a check's
  conclusion, so the check reports `SKIPPED` and the wrapper refuses whatever the reader did. `paths:` and
  `paths-ignore:` stop the workflow triggering, so its checks are **absent** from the rollup — which refuses
  today only because `ci.yml` is the sole workflow and an empty rollup takes the *no workflow has claimed this
  head* arm. Add a second and a filtered-out `ci.yml` contributes nothing to a rollup that is non-empty and
  green, so a missed filter is a merge rather than a delay. That count is held by
  `a_missed_path_filter_costs_a_delay_only_while_one_workflow_exists` rather than assumed, which is what makes
  this trigger a reaction instead of a sentence. The TOML half being promoted would also earn it, since the
  two share the argument if not the dependency. *Version class:* patch; `kanhe` is `publish = false` and the reader is a test.
  *Deferred here rather than done* on the same ground as the wrapper extraction: a dependency is not added at
  a release cut, and the reader is currently correct on every shape a fixture can construct.

- ~~**WATCH: the release gate's readers are slash-path-oriented, so a platform where cargo reports `\` is
  refused rather than judged.**~~ **CLOSED**, see below. *Class:* WATCH. *Observed pressure:* an external review of the `0.6.0` window
  read `machinery_names` building its prefix as `format!("{root}/")` and stripping it from each
  `manifest_path` as text, and `member_enumeration` repeating the pattern. Cargo reports native paths, so on
  Windows no member manifest would sit under the prefix. *Observation source:* that review, and the reading of
  the else-branch it did not take. *Current reaction or bound:* none declared, and a bound is the wrong
  carrier — nothing under-reacts here. The unmatched prefix reaches
  `cannot_judge_at("release-coherence#member-manifest-outside-workspace-root")`, so the gate **refuses
  loudly**, which is the direction this family prefers and the opposite of the silent skip the review inferred.
  *Risk:* an operator on a platform this repository does not run gets a refusal naming the workspace root
  rather than a judgement — a portability limit with a diagnostic, not a wrong verdict. Bounded by the eight
  CI jobs all being `ubuntu-latest` and by `kanhe` shipping in no package, so no adopter meets it.
  *Promotion trigger:* this repository's own suite running on a platform where cargo reports a native
  separator, or a contributor reporting the refusal. *Why not repaired now:* the repair is `Path` component
  work ending in an explicit slash-joined identity, which is the shape `xingbiao` already owns for the
  product — so the honest form is to reach for that owner rather than to hand-roll a second normalizer here,
  and reaching for it is a change with a subject rather than a patch. *Version class:* patch; the gate ships
  in no package. *Authority:* `release-coherence`.

  **CLOSED** by `fix(kanhe): a member's directory is stripped component-wise, not as text`. Both readers take
  the member's directory from its manifest path through `Path::strip_prefix`, and the identity is joined back
  with `/` because git's paths and this repository's prose spell one that way whatever the host does. The
  entry is kept for two corrections it earned. **Its severity reading was right and its conclusion was
  wrong**: the unmatched prefix does reach a cannot-judge and does refuse loudly, so nothing was ever
  mis-judged — and a loud refusal on every member of a workspace is still a gate that cannot run. **And the
  repair did not need the crate that owns canonical path identity**, which this entry named as its reason to
  defer: that edge would cross `kanhe`'s allowlist from `src` and need the amendment ritual, while the
  component comparison is `std` and is what the sibling reader already does. Deferring to an owner is right
  when the owner is reachable, and naming one that is not is how a repair stays filed longer than it costs.


## Version horizons

The version follows SemVer honesty (`AGENTS.md`), not milestone size: **non-breaking →
patch, breaking → minor**, and never a vanity minor bump. `AGENTS.md`'s *Versioning* section owns what
counts as breaking — any change the adopter has to act on, a stale recorded baseline included — so read
it before assigning a horizon here; the entries below are horizons, not a second definition.

- **0.2.x (shipped)** — additive depth on an existing observation source, false-negative closures. A
  historical record, not a precedent: those closures were classified as patch-class before the 0.4.0
  window settled that a change requiring adopter action earns a minor. The same work today is
  minor-class.
- **0.3.0 (shipped)** — stable rule identity (`RuleKey`), `StructuredFactIdentity`, unsafe-site decomposition, async seam identity.
- **0.4.0 (shipped)** — every compiled root governed, identity-coordinate completeness, the `cfg_if!`
  and conditional-remap conformance across all three dimensions.
- **The open window — minor-class (`0.5.0`).** It opened patch-class: packaging and
  hygiene, prose and specs, opt-in depth, performance, and diagnostics whose exit code and emitted documents
  do not move, with a false-negative closure explicitly deferred to the next minor. That deferral is what the
  window then spent. A bare-principal resolver closure landed carrying a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, and it
  earns a minor on the definition above rather than on its diff size. Stated against the **shipped** baseline,
  which is the only one a version answers to: in `0.4.0` a bare single-segment principal did not resolve at
  all, and now one the governed module declares does — new depth reacting by default, so a recorded baseline
  no longer describes the adopter's tree and regenerating it is work they did not choose. The window's own
  intermediate states (a fallback that over-reached, then the canonicalization that fixed it) are not the
  reason and must not be quoted as one: neither shipped, so neither is an upgrade anyone performs.
  `CHANGELOG.md` marks it `**BREAKING**` accordingly, and states the same delta from the same baseline.

  **What earns the minor is not classified here, and that is the repair rather than a smaller claim.**
  `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[0.5.0]` marks every entry requiring adopter action `**BREAKING**` and its `### Migration`
  section states each step. That classification has one owner and this is not it. What belongs here is the
  version *consequence*: pre-1.0, an adopter having to act earns a minor whatever the diff size, and a recorded
  baseline going stale is such an action — which is why `0.5.0` is minor-class rather than the patch it
  opened as.

  This paragraph used to classify it anyway: it named the bare-principal resolver closure as the one item, and
  called the rest of the window's public surface additive and therefore free. Both halves went stale inside the
  window. Another entry earned the mark — `Outcome::Clean` gaining the subject it was measured over — and it is
  part of the very surface the sentence called additive, carrying a `### Migration` bullet that reads *the
  compiler names every site*. Two owners for one classification, and the one with no producer drifted, which is
  the shape *Bind a claim to its measurement* refuses everywhere else.

  Re-derive the range rather than trusting a figure here — the counts this paragraph used to carry ("of the 44
  commits … the two other product-code touches") were written early and falsified by the window itself:

  ```bash
  git rev-list --count v0.4.0..HEAD                                   # commits in the window
  git log --format='' --name-only v0.4.0..HEAD -- crates \
    | grep '/src/' | grep -v '/tests' | sort -u                       # packaged sources it touched
  ```
  The **branch now carries the number**: `release/0.5.0` was renamed to `release/0.5.0` on 2026-08-06, so the
  first squash target names the release it will become — the role and the result agree, which is what
  `AGENTS.md`'s branch rule asks of every branch. The rename was clean because nothing pointed at the old
  name: no open pull request targeted it, CI triggers on `main` and on any pull request rather than on a
  branch name, and the only prose naming it was this paragraph.

  What was deliberately not done **as of 2026-08-06**, when the rename above happened: the version bump, the
  dated CHANGELOG section, the internal pins and `Cargo.lock`, which move together at release preparation.
  The 0.5.0 preparation has since done each.

  **This paragraph used to end by naming the gate's current answer, and that sentence was wrong three times
  in a row.** It said `development: 0.4.0`, was corrected to `release-ready: 0.5.0`, and was already false
  at the commit that froze it — the release squash makes HEAD's subject `release: X.Y.Z`, which is
  `State::Snapshot`, so the tree it shipped in reports `snapshot: 0.5.0`. A fourth correction would have been
  the same mistake again: **the gate's answer is a live state and this is a record.** What a record can say
  is the property and how to re-derive it, which is what the commit-count sentence above already does and
  what this one now does too:

  ```bash
  TIANHENG_WORKSPACE_TESTS=1 cargo test -p kanhe --test release_coherence \
    the_release_surfaces_are_coherent -- --nocapture     # prints `<state>: <version>` for the checkout
  ```

  The property that survives, and the only one this entry needed: **the gate reads versions, never a branch
  name** — grep the reaction for one and there is none — so the rename changed nothing it judges.
- **Next breaking window (if earned)** — requires real adopter or correctness pressure.

## Explicitly not on the roadmap

- Active code-shaping / generation.
- Prescriptive framework you build inside.
- Lints (opinionated style checks rather than declared intent).
- Universal graph API (whole-graph analysis rather than declared per-target boundaries).
- Supply-chain policy engine (cargo-deny's lane).
- DSL macro consolidation (repetitive builders are designed-to-be-imitated for 潛移 gravity; leave explicit).
