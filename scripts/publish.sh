# The sanctioned publish path: the source gate, then `cargo publish --workspace`.
#
# Why a wrapper rather than two documented steps. "Publish the tagged `main` commit, not the release
# branch" was already said in the 0.4.0 window, before 0.4.0 was published from the release branch
# anyway. The failure mode is not disagreement about the rule, it is a separate step skipped by habit
# at the one moment nothing can be undone — `.cargo_vcs_info.json` is stamped with the commit
# `cargo publish` ran on, and a published version can never be re-uploaded. Behind this script the
# gate stops being a step to remember: it is the only way to reach `cargo publish`, so skipping it
# means not publishing at all.
#
# Whether to publish stays outside. The publish is irreversible (a version is yankable, never
# deletable) and remains confirm-first with a human, and the Definition of Done, the packaged-tarball
# verification, and the bundled-license check all run before anyone arrives here.
#
# What may reach `cargo publish` is an ALLOWLIST. This script used to forward everything except
# `--manifest-path`, and its sibling `scripts/merge-pr.sh` learned what that costs: naming what may
# not pass leaked three times there, most sharply through spellings of flags whose long forms were
# already named. Enumerating what may pass means an argument this script does not know — including one
# a future cargo adds — is refused by default, which is the property a denylist cannot have. This
# family argues it in its own law: an allowlist is always stricter than a denylist.
#
# Classified against `cargo publish --help` on cargo 1.96.0 by one question: does the argument move
# what the gate judged, or what the act records? Admitted are the arguments that change only whether
# and how the publish proceeds. Refused are the ones that move the source tree (`--manifest-path`),
# the set of crates (`--exclude`, and the `--workspace` this script supplies itself), what cargo
# verifies before uploading (`--no-verify`, the feature and target selectors), what gets packaged
# (`--allow-dirty`), and `--config`, which can become any of those and can name a whole configuration
# file besides.
#
# **Admitting an argument takes TWO questions, not one.** The first is above. The second is whether cargo
# actually HONOURS it beside what this script supplies itself — and `--package` failed that one silently:
# written after an unconditional `--workspace`, cargo discarded it and published everything. Classify
# against the tool's real behaviour at a named version, not against its `--help` alone.
#
# Two classifications are worth their sentence. `--package` narrows by NAMING, which a partly
# completed publish genuinely needs — crates.io accepts the six one at a time and a resumed run must
# say which — and the command then records what it did; `--exclude` narrows by SUBTRACTION under the
# `--workspace` this script would otherwise supply, so the invocation reads as the whole workspace while
# publishing less. And `--allow-dirty` was forwarded before, on the ground that the source gate
# refuses a dirty tree upstream anyway: that makes it inert rather than safe, and inert-by-someone-
# else is not how this script holds anything.
#
# `--registry` and `--index` stay admitted, keeping the reasoning that admitted them: they change the
# publish's DESTINATION, not its source, which is a different claim from the one this wrapper and its
# gate make. `--token` no longer joins them — cargo 1.96.0 answers it with `\`cargo publish --token\`
# is deprecated in favor of using \`cargo login\` and environment variables`, so the refusal points
# where cargo does.
#
# ONE spelling each, values as separate arguments. Parsing a tool's glued and equals forms is exactly
# what let the short forms through the sibling wrapper; refusing them costs an argument's worth of
# typing and removes the parsing question entirely.

# The two exit classes, chosen here and nowhere else — the same two its sibling `scripts/merge-pr.sh` states.
#
# `2` is everything this script could not judge: a misconfigured invocation, and an input it could not read.
# `1` is a gate that ran and refused. A gate that did NOT run belongs to the first class, however loudly its
# own message says so.
#
# The argument refusals below run BEFORE the gate, not after: a refusal must not depend on the gate's own

# A value-taking flag's value, checked for both ways it can be wrong: absent, and flag-shaped.
#
# **A value position is not a place a refused flag may sit.** The arms below checked only that *something*
# followed, and cargo does not consume a flag-shaped value — measured on cargo 1.96.0,
# `cargo publish --package --no-verify` packages **without verifying**, byte-identical to passing
# `--no-verify` alone, and exits 0 with no complaint about a package by that name. So every refusal this file
# argues for was reachable through the one selector it admits.
#
# Held for every value-taking arm rather than the one that leaked. cargo's own handling differs per flag —
# some consume the value and fail later, some are refused by clap — but that is a fact about cargo's error
# paths at one version, and a wrapper standing in front of an irreversible act does not rest on the tool
# failing correctly. The property is the script's own: an argument it did not name does not travel, wherever
# it was written.
#
# Checked by SHAPE rather than against the refusal list, because the list is not the property, and the refusal
# SAYS the shape rather than explaining cargo. The first form told the operator that cargo *reads the value as
# an argument of its own* — true of `--package --no-verify`, and false of most of what it stops: measured,
# `--jobs --allow-dirty` has cargo consume the value and fail later with `could not parse --allow-dirty`, and
# `--registry --config` is refused by clap with `a value is required for '--registry <REGISTRY>'`. Three
# mechanisms, one sentence, so the sentence was wrong twice. What is true of every arm is this script's own
# property: it does not accept a value beginning with `-`.
#
# **The sacrifice is `--jobs -N`, and it is named rather than left silent.** cargo documents a negative job
# count — *If negative, it sets the maximum number of parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus
# provided value* — and measured, `cargo publish --jobs -1 --dry-run` packages and verifies normally. This
# script refuses it. Admitting it would need a per-arm rule, since a leading digit means nothing for
# `--package` or `--registry`, and a rule that differs per arm is the thing one shape check exists to avoid.
# The cost is one arithmetic step for the caller: pass the count. `repository-checks` carries it as a stated
# bound.
