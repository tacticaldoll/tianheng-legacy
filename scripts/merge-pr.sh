# The sanctioned merge path: the squash-message gate, then `gh pr merge --squash`.
#
# Why a wrapper rather than a documented rule. `AGENTS.md` already says the squash subject is the pull
# request's title with no auto-appended `(#N)`; nine subjects, counted when this wrapper was written, carry that serial
# anyway, the most recent on the commit that landed a check for a requirement enforced by nothing. The
# failure mode is not disagreement about the rule — it is one string typed at the one moment nothing can be
# undone. A merged squash cannot be repaired: amending it changes its hash, and the pull request's merge
# record cites that hash, so the two would name different things afterwards.
#
# Nothing here carries a verdict. The judgement is `crates/kanhe/tests/merge_message.rs`, a Rust repository check
# like every other one judging this repository; this script gathers the inputs and refuses to reach `gh`
# without it.
#
# What stays outside, and what no longer does. WHETHER to merge remains a human's call. Whether CI AGREED
# does not: `require_ci_green` below reads the rollup and refuses, unconditionally, because the alternative
# was measured — this wrapper merged nineteen consecutive red runs on the difference between a local
# Definition of Done and the superset CI runs. So this holds what the merge is about to record AND that the
# suite agreed about it.
#
# This sentence said both were a human's call until 2026-08-21, and `require_ci_green` had landed 204 commits
# earlier. A premise its own new code had falsified, left standing where an operator reads it first — and the
# `--admin` arm below was reasoned from it, which is how a stale premise spreads rather than merely sits.
#
# A merge made in the GitHub web UI reaches no wrapper at all; that is a declared bound, not an oversight.

# **Ambient repository selectors are cleared before anything reads a repository.**
#
# `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE` and `GIT_INDEX_FILE` move WHICH repository a git command acts on, past
# `current_dir` and past `-C`. `kanhe::hermetic_git::hermetic` removes them for every git this repository
# builds in Rust, and its doc says why in so many words; this wrapper — standing in front of the one
# irreversible act — inherited them.
# `GH_REPO` moves which repository an otherwise implicit `gh` command acts on past that same current
# directory. The first `gh repo view` below supplies its answer explicitly to every later call, so an ambient
# value would move the whole workflow consistently and leave no later mismatch to expose the substitution.
#
# What they defeat is the guard below, not merely a read. That guard compares the worktree holding this
# wrapper's gate against the worktree its evidence comes from, so that a wrapper invoked by absolute path
# from another checkout cannot judge one repository's pull request by another repository's law. Measured on
# this machine's git, with the two pointed at a third repository:
#
#   no selectors:      git -C gate rev-parse --show-toplevel -> .../gate    git (cwd=other) -> .../other
#   pointed at decoy:  git -C gate rev-parse --show-toplevel -> .../decoy   git (cwd=other) -> .../decoy
#
# Both answer the decoy, so the comparison PASSES in exactly the arrangement it was written to refuse, and
# it vouches for an equality about a tree that is neither the gate's nor the evidence's. `gh` resolves its
# repository through the local remote as well, which is why this is cleared here rather than at the guard.
#
# The configuration channels are not in scope and that is deliberate rather than an omission: this script's
# git calls are `rev-parse --show-toplevel`, which configuration does not move. The selectors do.

# `1` is a gate that ran and refused. The contract is this repository's own — `crates/shengmo/src/law.rs`:
# *0 clean, 1 violation, 2 constitution/usage error* — and its sibling `scripts/publish.sh` states the rule for
# arguments already.
#
# **Five could-not-read conditions were split across both classes with no rule.** An unresolvable repository
# exited 2 while an unreadable body file, an unreadable head, an unresolvable pull-request number and an
# unreadable commit set exited 1. Two of those facts are ones the gate this wrapper fronts types the other way:
# `merge_message_gate::judge` returns cannot-judge for an unavailable title and for unavailable commit subjects,
# because "which is not the same fact as a subject that disagrees". So the wrapper reported as a disagreement
# what its own gate calls unjudgeable — telling an operator, in the words of the sibling publish gate, "to go
# looking for a disagreement that does not exist".

# positional selector and the body-file guard exited through a bare `usage; exit 2` carrying none of the
# prefix above; the URL refusal hand-copied that function's body because both helpers were defined below it;
# and `require_value` re-spelled it fifty-nine lines after it. Every stop now delegates, and what decides that

    # This was a DENYLIST and it leaked three times: a `--repo` flag, a positional pull-request URL, and every
    # SHORT spelling of the flags the long-form arms named. `gh` accepts `-t` for `--subject` and `-F` for
    # `--body-file`, this wrapper splices the passthrough AFTER its own flags, and `gh` takes the LAST
    # occurrence of a repeated flag — measured on gh 2.95.0, where `--body-file A -F B` and `-F A --body-file B`
    # both read B. So one unlisted spelling replaced the very message the gate had just approved.
    #
    # Enumerating what to forbid is the shape that failed. This enumerates what may pass, so a flag the wrapper
    # does not know — including one a future `gh` adds — is refused by default, which is the property a
    # denylist cannot have. This family already argues it in its own law: an allowlist is always stricter than
    # a denylist.
    #
    # Classified against `gh pr merge --help` on gh 2.95.0 by TWO questions. First: does it move what the gate
    # judged? Second: does gh honour it as this wrapper composes the invocation — beside the `--squash`,
    # `--subject` and `--body-file` written below? The second question was missing, and the sibling
    # publish wrapper paid for it: it admitted `--package` beside an unconditional `--workspace`, which cargo
    # silently maps to *all packages*. Here the same question refuses `--auto` and `--disable-auto`: one defers
    # the merge past the evidence the gate read, the other is not a merge at all.
    #
    # Forwarded are the flags that change whether the merge may proceed, never what it would record, and never
    # WHEN it happens relative to the evidence.
    #
    # ONE spelling each, values as separate arguments. Parsing gh's glued and equals forms is what let the
    # short forms through; refusing those costs an argument's worth of typing and removes the parsing question.
    # `--admin` is admitted for what it still does: bypass required **reviews**. In a single-steward
    # repository a pull request's author cannot approve their own, so `require_code_owner_reviews` cannot be
    # satisfied by the person merging — which `PROJECT.md` records as a judgement boundary rather than a
    # mechanism. That is a real and remaining use.
    #
    # **What it no longer does is bypass CI, and the arm used to be reasoned from that.** It said this was
    # consistent with *whether CI is green stays a human's call*; `require_ci_green` refuses a red or
    # unfinished rollup, so passing `--admin` to force a red merge through this path does not work and is
    # not meant to. Use the web UI for that, and meet no gate at all — which is the declared bound the
    # header names, not a loophole this arm opens.
    #
    # **That sentence used to say `before gh is reached` and rest the whole claim on it, which is a claim
    # about an ordering rather than about the flag.** It was true of the read and not of the merge: the
    # rollup was read among the guards above the post-gate block, so a required check re-run on the same
    # head could turn it red with every later guard still passing. The read is the last guard now, which is
    # what makes the sentence about the flag again — and the residual is the declared post-gate bound rather
    # than this arm.
    #
    # **Where the flag reaches at all is measured rather than assumed, because a review read it as a
    # privilege escalation.** Asked of this repository on 2026-09-08: the development base every squash
    # lands on answers `404 Branch not protected`, so there are no required checks there to bypass; and the
    # release base is protected with seven required checks and `enforce_admins` **enabled**, so GitHub
    # refuses an administrator's bypass of them. The flag reaches required reviews, which is the arm above,
    # and reaches no check on either base. That is a fact about this repository's settings rather than about
    # `gh`, so it is stated with its date and re-asked rather than trusted.
    #
    # It is the only flag admitted here, and the criterion above is why. `--delete-branch` shared this arm
    # with no sentence of its own: it changes neither whether the merge proceeds, nor what it records, nor

# bytes the gate could not read took an arm that printed "not judged" and returned, so `1 passed` was true
# and nothing had been judged. The two guards catch different states and both stay: `require_one_pass` sees a
# renamed test (nothing ran), this sees a test that ran, passed, and reached no verdict.
#
# The gate now writes the channel on its clean arm too, so *absent on success* means unjudged by
# construction rather than by a wrapper remembering to check. Held against `kanhe::verdict_channel::CLEAN` by
# `crates/kanhe/tests/gate_exit_classes.rs`, so neither spelling can drift from the gate's side.

# The other suite: what CI said about this pull request's head.
#
# **Measured, this wrapper merged nineteen consecutive red runs.** Every local gate reported green each time —
# the Definition of Done is the LOCAL pre-flight list and says so, and CI runs a superset of it. One job in
# that superset, the MSRV build, is not in the local list because it installs a toolchain and rebuilds the
# workspace; a single `if let … && …` that the default toolchain accepts and 1.85 refuses was therefore red in
# CI and green here, through nineteen merges, until someone ran the job by hand.
#
# So the wrapper reads the same answer it already reads for its own gate: a verdict, not an inference. Three
# states, and the middle one is why a boolean would not do — a run still in flight is not a run that failed,
# and merging on "not success" would refuse a pull request whose checks simply have not finished.
#
# `--json` rather than the human table, because the table is a display this wrapper does not own. An empty
# conclusion is a check still running; a missing rollup is a head no workflow has claimed, which is its own
# cannot-judge rather than a pass — a pull request nothing has checked is not a pull request that checked out.
require_ci_green() {
    # **One read, three states derived from it.** The first form asked two independent jq filters about
    # `statusCheckRollup`, and a pull request with *no checks at all* is a value neither can produce: the
    # disagreement filter answers the empty string and the unfinished filter answers zero, so nothing refused
    # and the merge ran. That is the same false-negative direction as the nineteen red merges this guard was
    # written for, reintroduced by the guard — and unreachable by construction rather than by omission, which
    # is why the states are now read off one answer instead of asked for separately.
    #
    # `\t` between the conclusion and the name because a check name carries spaces (`MSRV (rust-version)`),
    # and stderr is left on the terminal rather than folded into the value: the first form captured it with
    # `2>&1` and then tested the value for emptiness, so a notice on a SUCCESSFUL call would have been
    # reported as `CI has not agreed about this pull request: <notice>` — a refusal naming a check that does
    # not exist. The pending read handled the same stream the opposite way, discarding it entirely, and that
    # disagreement between the two is what made the pair worth reading as one.

    # **The rollup is a UNION of two node shapes, and reading one of them is not reading it.** GitHub's

    # and a `StatusContext` — an external commit status — carries `.state`/`.context` and neither of the
    # first two. So the earlier filter answered `""` and `"?"` for every commit status, and a FAILED one was
    # classified as *unfinished* and reported as `these checks have not finished: ?` — a refusal naming a
    # check that does not exist. That is verbatim the defect `require_ci_green`'s stderr-capture note already
    # records fixing once, where folding a successful call's notice into the value produced `CI has not
    # agreed about this pull request: <notice>`; the same wrong sentence, reached through the node shape the
    # filter never read.

    # Fail-closed either way, so this was latent rather than live: this repository runs GitHub Actions and
